# 01. Getting Started

## 001. Welcome to the Course

- Welcome to the comprehensive Udemy course on complete Machine Learning and NLP, with end-to-end projects & MLOps, with over 13+ years of experience in Data Analytics industry and 7+ years of teaching experience, instructor has worked with renowned companies like Panasonic, Sapient, HoneyWell, E&Y and many more
- In this course, we'll deep dive into the fascinating world of Machine Learning starting from the basics and building up to the advanced concepts
- We'll cover everything from mathematical intuition behind all the Machine Learning algorithms to their practical implementations along with end-to-end projects till deployments
- We'll also learn various `open-source tools` like `mlflow`, `DVC`, `BentoML`, and many more
- You'll master all the `Machine Learning Algorithms` such as `Linear Regression`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, `SVN`, `Naive Baye's`
- Along with this, we'll also learn about all the techniques that are required in understanding `Natural Language Processing`, and `Neural Network`
- We'll break down the mathematics that powers these algorithms, ensuring you have a solid theoretical understanding
- But, we won't stop there, `Practical Intuition` is the key, we'll implement these algorithms completely from basics to advanced, and see them in action through various real-world applications
- One of the unique aspects of this course is our focus on end-to-end projects, you'll get hands-on experience with `CI/CD Pipelines`, `Github Actions` and `MLOps` using open-source tools like `mlflow`, `BentoML` and `DVC`
- Here, we're also including `Cloud Deployments` like `Azure` and `AWS`
- By the end of this course, you'll be proficient in deploying Machine Learning models and managing their entire `Lifecycle`
- In this course, we'll also delve into `Natural Language Processing` covering essential `Text Pre-Processing techniques` such as `One-Hot Encoding`, `Bag of Words`, `TF-IDF`, `Word2Vec` and `Average Word2Vec`
- You'll gain the skill to tackle text-related projects and understand the working of `NLP` in Machine Learning
- As a bonus, instructor has included a complete section of `Deep Learning`, you'll learn the mathematical intuition behind `Neural Networks`, `Optimizers`, `Loss Function` including `Convolution Neural Network (CNN)`, this bonus content will give you a well-rounded understanding of both traditional and advanced Machine Learning
- So, whether you're a beginner or looking to advance you skills into the `Data Analytics` industry, this course is designed to equip you with the knowledge & practical experience you need to excel in the field of Machine Learning and NLP

## 003. Anaconda Installation

- In this lecture, we're going to install `anaconda` and `VS code` which will be our IDE
- In VS Code, you can execute your code both in `.ipynb` format or `.py` format
- Before we install VS Code, we'll install anaconda
- Anaconda is one amazing open-source tool that provides the eco-system for sourcing, building and deploying data science and AI initiatives
- If you want to work with multiple environments, multiple packages, this will be the best thing to have to get started with python programming language
- It becomes necessary for everyone to use it, because package management and environment management becomes very easy, and it is required when working with different versions of python
- First of all, goto anaconda's website, navigate to downloads section, and go for free download, next choose your operating system to download thr installer
- Once `.exe` file download is complete, open the installer, hit next, agree to license, you may select Just me  option so it'll install anaconda only for current user, then you may change the installation directory which by default is in C drive, and hit next, in advanced installation options, check the option to add anaconda 3 to PATH environment variable and leave other options as it is, then click on install
- Once installation completes, make sure the installation path for anaconda 3 is showing with `anaconda3`, `anaconda3\Library\bin`, `anaconda3\Scripts` in the environment variable PATH, otherwise, you'll need to add it
- Once anaconda installation is complete, open Start Menu and search for `Anaconda Navigator` & open it
- Once Anaconda Navigator is open, you have Jupyter Notebook, you can click on Jupyter notebook to launch it, and you have other things too such as  PyCharm, Datalore, IBM Watson Studio, all of which are different entities
  - In the environments section on left side, you can create a new environment, and see existing environments
- Next, you need to install VS Code, and for that google search for `VS Code download`, and open the first link you get, based on you OS, you can download the installer
- Once installer has downloaded, open it , do next-next, and installation will be complete
  - Once VS Code is installed, To start VS Code IDE, open the command prompt (cmd), navigate to the directory which you want to open in VS Code using command `cd` , then run command

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

    Or you may open that directory in File Explorer, right-click, select option Open if VS Code
  - Once VS Code is open, it'll show you the directory which you've opened, and then you may create a new file, a new folder, create a file named `test.ipynb` and start coding in it
- Two things we have done in this video, one was to download anaconda, install it, set up PATH environment variable, and other thing was to download VS Code, install it, and open a folder in it
