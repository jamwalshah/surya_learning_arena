# 01. Machine Learning - Statistics - Basic Probability Models and Rules

## Basic Probability Rules and Models

- **Probability** gives us the information about how likely an event can occur.

## Terminologies

1. **Trial or Experiment:** The act that leads to a result with certain possibility
2. **Sample Space:** The set of all possible outcomes of an Experiment
3. **Event:** Non-empty subset of sample space is known as Event

- In technical terms, **Probability** is the measure of how likely an event is when an Experiment is conducted

## Basic Probability Calculation

- As per definition, if **A** is an event of an experiment and it contains **n** outcomes and **S** is the sample space then

  ${P(A)} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}P(E_i)$

  - where ${E_1 ... E_n}$ are the outcomes in **A**
- If all the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely then

  ${P(A) = \frac{No.\ of\ outcomes\ in\ A}{No.\ of\ outcomes\ in\ A}}$

> Hence the value of probability is between **0 and 1**

- As the sample space is the whole possible set of outcomes
  
  ${P(S) = 1}$

## Complement of Event A

- Denoted by ${A^c}$
- Complement of an event A means **not(A**)
- Probability of complement event of A means the probability of all the outcomes in sample space other than the ones in A

  ${P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)}$

## Union and Intersection of Events

- The probability of **intersection** of two events **A** and **B** is ${P(A \cap B)}$
- When event A occurs in union with event B the probability together is defined as

  ${P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)}$

  - this Probability of Union is also known as **Addition Rule of Probability**

## Mutually Exclusive Events

- Any two events are mutually exclusive when they have non-overlapping outcomes, i.e., if **A** and **B** are two mutually exclusive  events then

  ${P(A \cap B) = 0}$

- From the above, addition rule of probability becomes

  ${P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)}$

  - as **A** and **B** are disjoint or mutually exclusive events

## Independent Events

- Any two events are independent of each other if one has zero effect on the other, i.e., the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other
- If **A** and **B** are two independent events then

  ${P(A \cap B) = P(A) * P(B)}$

## Sum Rule of Events

- Sum rule states that

  ${P(A) = \sum_{B}P(A\ and\ B)}$

- This is also known as **Marginal Probability** as it denotes the probability of event **A** by removing out the influence of other events that it is together defined with

### Example

- **Question:** If the probability that it rains on Tuesday is 0.2 and the probability that it rains on other days this week is 0.5, what is the probability  that it'll rain this week?
- **Solution:** From the sum rule

  ${P(rain) = P(\text{rain and it is a Tuesday}) + P(\text{rain and it is not Tuesday})}$

  Hence ${P(rain) = 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.7}$
