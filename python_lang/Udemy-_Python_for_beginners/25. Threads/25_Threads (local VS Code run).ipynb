        "- Till now all code we have written was single threaded\n",

        "- ```Single threaded Application```\n",
        "    - if an application does not have any other thread except the ```main()``` thread, then it is a single threaded application\n",
        "- Multiple threads are created\n",
        "    - to make the best use of underlying processor\n",
        "    - to improve the performance & user experience of the application\n",

        "    1. Import ```threading``` module & Create an instance of ```Thread``` class or extend it\n",

        "        1. import the ```threading``` module, and extend the ```Thread``` class into your custom thread class\n",
