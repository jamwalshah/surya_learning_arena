        "    - Abstract method will not have any implementation, and it will be marked with ```@abstractmethod``` decorator\n",
        "    - Any class inheriting the Abstract class will have to implement the abstract method\n",
        "        - If we don't implement abstract class in child class, then that child class will also become abstract class\n",
        "        - Atleast one method in Abstract class is an abstract method\n",
        "\n",
        "    - You can't create an object of an abstract class, it exists just to provide a contract for the child classes\n",
        "        - If all the mehtods in a class are non-Abstract, then you can create an instance of it\n",
        "        - you need to implement abstract method in every child class that inherits abstract class, otherwise python does not allow to instatntiate the child class without the implementation of abstract method\n",
