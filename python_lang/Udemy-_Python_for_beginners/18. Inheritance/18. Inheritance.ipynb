        "- Inheritance is the process of defining new object with the help of an existing object\n",
        "- Example:\n",

        "    2. Updating the existing obkect's functionality int the newer/inherited object\n",

        "    1. Re-Usability\n",
        "        - common properties can be put in parent class and then reused in child classs\n",
        "        - car class can be inherited by BMW and Audi\n",
