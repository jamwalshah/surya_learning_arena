# 07. Django ORM

## 056. The Fundamentals

- When you used `empApp.models.Employee.objects.all()` in `views.py` file, you got a list of employees from the database which is nothing but Django ORM (Object Relational Mapping) in action, so without writing any SQL queries you got the employees' records
- In this and the next few lectures, we're going to explore the Django ORM in detail
- To do that, we don't have to work in the IDE, can learn all that from the shell or the command-line
  - Goto your terminal/command-line, make sure you're under `djangoprojects/modelDemo` project, once you're in that directory, open a python shell with Django support inside it using below command

  ```bash
  python manage.py shell
  ```

  - First step is to import the Model class `Employee`, all the Django libraries are available for us but we simply need to import them

  ```python
  from empApp.models import Employee
  ```

  - Once the model `Employee` is imported, you can do all kinds of operations here, now create a `Query Set` which will contain all the records from the database using the method `Employee.objects.all()`

  ```python
  qs = Employee.objects.all()
  ```

  - Now check the type of the Query set variable `qs` using command below and it'll show type as `<class 'django.db.models.query.QuerySet'>`

  ```python
  print(type(qs))
  ```

  - If you want only one record at a time, you'll use `Employee.objects.get(id=1)` method with `id=1` as its primary key, and it'll return only one record as a `Employee` model object

  ```python
  emp = Employee.objects.get(id=1)
  ```

  - To check the type of the object that `Model.objects.get(PrimaryKey=1)` method returns, use the command below and it'll show type as `<class 'empApp.models.Employee'>` which is `Employee` model class type

  ```python
  print(type(emp))
  ```

  - To print the query set object use below command, it'll print only generic text indicating `Employee object (1)` indicating the Query Set has `id=1`

  ```python
  print(emp)
  ```

  - If you override the `__str__()` method inside the `Employee` model class, you'll see an appropriate text while printing it, or you can refer to a specific field from the model class with Query set object to print it as shown in snippet below

  ```python
  print(emp.firstName)
  ```

- So, `django.db.models.Model.objects.all()` returns a Query set with all the records, but if you want a specific record you'll use `django.db.models.Model.objects.get(PrimaryKey=1)`
- if you want to see what exact query is being run in the background, run print command for `QuerySet.query` attribute

    ```python
    print(qs.query)
    ```

  - So it'll show you the SQL query that it runs in the backgound

  ```SQL
  SELECT `empApp_employee`.`id`, `empApp_employee`.`firstName`, `empApp_employee`.`lastName`, `empApp_employee`.`salary`, `empApp_employee`.`email` FROM `empApp_employee`
  ```

- So ORM is helping us by generating this query, we simply need to use the methods such as
  - `Model.objects.all()` to generate the Query Set
  - `QuerySet.query` property/attribute to return the query
- In this lecture, we've learnt how to retrieve multiple records using `all()`, how to retrieve a single record using `get()` which returns a Model object, the type of variable that holds the list of records is a `QuerySet`, How to print the Query behind the `QuerySet` using the `QuerySet.query` attribute

## 057. Filtering Data

- In the previous lecture, we've seen that the queries that Django ORM uses behind the scenes does not have any `WHERE` clause, that is it fetches all the records from the database which is okay, but if you want to add some criteria Django ORM offers various various classes that you can use inside a `filter()` function
- So, if you want to filter data in the Query set returned by `Model.objects.all()`, instead of `.all()` method we use `.filter()` method and pass it the criteria
  - To pass a criteria use the syntax `<fieldName/AttributeName>__<className>=<values>`, and you can use any of these below classes and more, which are available in the documentation
  - `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `contains`, `icontains`, `in`, `startswith`, `endswith`
- So, anything that you do using SQL statements against a database, can be done using Django ORM
- If I want all the employees with `salary` greater than `gt` `5000`, so use this snippet to generate a `QuerySet`

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.filter(salary__gt=5000)
  ```

  - If you try to print the `QuerySet` returned by the previous command, you'll see only one record, `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (1)>]>` which indicates `Employee` object with `id=1`

  ```python
  print(emps)
  ```

- You can also try to find all the employees with `salary` greater than or equal to `gte` `5000`, so use the below snippet

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.filter(salary__gte=5000)
  ```

  - Now print the returned `QuerySet` , and you'll see two objects with `id=1` and `id=2` , output will show `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (1)>, <Employee: Employee object (2)>]>`

  ```python
  print(emps)
  ```

- So, its that simple to filter out data

> Instead of `Model.objects.filter()` function, we can also use `Model.objects.get()`, but only when we're sure we'll only get a single record

- We can also use several other classes using `contains`, `icontains` (`i` stands for case-insensitive search), so lets try these out
  - `contains` class is like SQL `LIKE` clause
  - Filter the data using below snippet for employees whose `firstName` contains `Sur`

    ```python
    emps = Employee.objects.get(firstName__contains='Sur')
    ```

    - Now print the returned `Employee` object and you'll see only one record as `Employee object (1)`

    ```python
    print(emps)
    ```

  - Filter the data using below snippet for employees whose `firstName` contains `sur`, so it'll show an error `empApp.models.Employee.DoesNotExist: Employee matching query does not exist.`

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.get(firstName__contains='sur')
  ```

  - Filter the data case-insensitively using below snippet for employees whose `firstName` contains `sur`

    ```python
    emps = Employee.objects.get(firstName__icontains='sur')
    ```

    - Now print the returned `Employee` object and you'll see only one record as `Employee object (1)`, because  it is a case-insensitive search

    ```python
    print(emps)
    ```

- Similary, you can use `in`, `startswith`, `emdswith`
- Lets filter based on `in`, it can return multiple records so lets not use `Model.objects.get()` function, instead use `Model.objects.filter()`
  - Filter the data using below snippet for employees whose `id` is in `1`, `2`

    ```python
    emps = Employee.objects.filter(id__in=[1,2])
    ```

    - Now print the returned `QuerySet` and you'll see two records as `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (1)>, <Employee: Employee object (2)>]>`

    ```python
    print(emps)
    ```

  - Filter the data using below snippet for employees whose `firstName` starts with `startswith` `Sa`

    ```python
    emps = Employee.objects.filter(firstName__startswith='Sa')
    ```

    - Now print the returned `QuerySet` and you'll see only one record with `id=2` as `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (2)>]>`

    ```python
    print(emps)
    ```

  - Filter the data using below snippet for employees whose `firstName` ends with `endswith` `ya`

    ```python
    emps = Employee.objects.filter(firstName__endswith='ya')
    ```

    - Now print the returned `QuerySet` and you'll see only one record with `id=1` as `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (1)>]>`

    ```python
    print(emps)
    ```

- So, in this lecture we have seen how to filter out the datausing several classes we can use, typically we do this using `WHERE` clause in our `SELECT` query, but here thanks to Django ORM we can use these classes to pass to `Model.objects.filter()` method

## 058. Using Logical Operators

- In this lecture, we'll see how to use the logical operators like `And` `&`, `Or` `|` and `Not`inside the `Model.objects.filter()` method

`Syntax 1` - `&` and `|`

- To do that, create a `QuerySet` with `Model.objects.filter()` method based on `firstName` `startswith` `Sa` or `Model.objects.filter()` method based on `lastName` `startswith` `Ja`, while `or` operator is represented using `|` symbol

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.filter(firstName__startswith='Sa')|Employee.objects.filter(lastName__startswith='Ja')
  ```

  - Now print the returned `QuerySet` and you'll see only one `Employee` Model object in output as `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (2)>]>`, although the `lastName` doesn't match with `Ja` it still returns one record because the `firstName` matches `Sa`

  ```python
  print(emps)
  ```

`Syntax 2` - `&` and `|`

- This above is a long syntax to use, another way to do this is to first import a special class `Q` from `django.db.models` as indicated in below snippet

```python
from django.db.models import Q
```

- Now we can pass multiple classes within single `Model.objects.filter()` method by wrapping the filtering classes inside the `Q`function and combining these `Q` classes using logical operators such as or `|`

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.filter(Q(firstName__startswith='Sa') | Q(lastName__startswith='Ja'))
  ```

  - Now print the returned `QuerySet` and you'll see only one `Employee` Model object in output as `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (2)>]>` , as seen in the long syntax previously

  ```python
  print(emps)
  ```

- Now, you've learnt a couple of synataxes, the first one is to invoke the `Model.objects.filter()` method a couple of times, and the second syntax is to import the `Q` class from `django.db.models` and then you can pass the criteria right there
- Lets see how 'And' logical operator works
- Take the previous synatax with `Q` class method, and replace the `or` `|` with `and` `&`

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.filter(Q(firstName__startswith='Sa') & Q(lastName__startswith='Ja'))
  ```

  - Now if you print the returned `QuerySet` it'll return nothing in output as `<QuerySet []>` because there is no record in the database that matches `firstName` `startswith` `Sa` and `&` `lastName` `endswith` `Ja`

  ```python
  print(emps)
  ```

- Run the above command again but change the `lastName` `startswith` to `T`

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.filter(Q(firstName__startswith='Sa') & Q(lastName__startswith='T'))
  ```

  - Now if you print the returned `QuerySet` you'll see in output as `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (2)>]>` indicaiting one record

  ```python
  print(emps)
  ```

`Syntax 3` - `&`

- There is one more syntax that you can use in which you mention multiple criteria separated by comma `,` as shown in snippet below, which is another working of `And` `&` logical operator

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.filter(firstName__startswith='Sa', lastName__startswith='T')
  ```

  - Now print the returned `QuerySet` using below command and we get a `QuerySet` as `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (2)>]>` indicating one record

  ```python
  print(emps)
  ```

`Syntax 4` - `Not`

- So you've learnt couple of syntaxes to work with `&` and `|`, but if you want to use `Not`, you'll use the `Model.objects.exclude()` function instead of `Model.objects.filter()` function, and pass to it whatever criteria you want, so it'll exclude all the records that matches the specified criteria

  ```python
  emps = Employee.objects.exclude(salary__gt=5000)
  ```

  - Now print the returned `QuerySet` so you'll see `<QuerySet [<Employee: Employee object (2)>]>` indicating one record with `id=2` which does not match the criteria

  ```python
  print(emps)
  ```

- So you can use `and` `&`, `or` `|` and `not`as well using `Model.objects.exclude()` logical operators

## 059. Selective Columns

- When we get back the data from the database, we'll get all the columns in the database
- If I run the below command, I'll get all the columns from the `emps` `QuerySet` that I have  

```python
from empApp.Models import Employee
emps = Employee.objects.all()
```

- But If you want a few columns, you can use `django.db.models.QuerySet.values_list()` method and you pass the column names to it
- Also there are other two methods besides this to get only specific columns

1. `Method 1` - `django.db.model.QuerySet.values_list(columnNames)`

    - Now run the below command which utilizes `django.db.model.QuerySet.values_list(columnNames)` method to get only `firstName` and `salary` columns

    ```python
    emps = Employee.objects.all().values_list('firstName', 'salary')
    ```

2. `Method 2` - `django.db.models.QuerySet.values(columnNames)`

    - Another way to fetch specific columns is to use 'django.db.models.QuerySet.values(columnNames)` to get only `firstName` and `salary` columns

    ```python
    emps = Employee.objects.all().values('firstName', 'salary')
    ```

3. `Method 3` - `django.db.models.QuerySet.only(columnNames)`

    - Last way to fetch specific columns is to use 'django.db.models.QuerySet.only(columnNames)` to get only `firstName` and `salary` columns

    ```python
    emps = Employee.objects.all().only('firstName', 'salary')
    ```

> There is almost no difference between `.values_list()` and `.values()` methods, but the difference that `.only()` method has is that it by default includes `id` column in returned `QuerySet` although you asked for some other specific columns

- So, If you want to specify which columns you want, you can do that by using `.value_list()`, `.values()` or `.only()` methods

## 060. Aggregate Functions

- Django offers several functions to perform aggregate operations like average, maximum, minimum, sum and count
- To use those, we need to import them

```python
from django.db.models import Avg, Sum, Max, Min, Count
```

- First, Lets do average of them, we first fetch all the records using `Django.db.models.Model.objects.all()` which returns a `QuerySet`, and on that `QuerySet` we use `django.db.models.QuerySet.aggregate()` to which we pass the aggregate function along with the column name like `Avg('salary')`

  ```python
  avg = Employee.objects.all().aggregate(Avg('salary'))
  ```

  - So to use aggregate function, you use `QuerySet.aggregate()` function and pass one of the `Avg()`, `Sum()`, `Max()`, `Min()`, `Count()` function to it
  - Now, print the average salary, which should return `{'salary__avg': 52500.0}` in which `salary__avg` is created dynamically

  ```python
  print(avg)
  ```

- Similary, you can also use `Sum()` function

  ```python
  sum = Employee.objects.all().aggregate(Sum('salary'))
  ```

  - Now print the value of sum of salaries of all the employees, which should return `{'salary__sum': 105000.0}`

  ```python
  print(sum)
  ```

- Lets, find the count of salaries of employees

  ```python
  count = Employee.objects.all().aggregate(Count('salary'))
  ```

  - Now, print the count of salaries of all the employees, which should return `{'salary__count': 2}`

  ```python
  print(count)
  ```

- You can try out `Max()` and `Min()` on your own
- Remember the syntax, you fetch the records, then use `.aggregate()` function, and pass in one of the aggregate functions

## 061. Create

- So far, you've performed the `R`ead operation, and in the next few lectures, you're going to learn `C`reate, `D`elete and `U`pdate on the `Employee` table
- There are two ways in which we can create an employee, but first lets check how many employees are there in the database, so below comand will return us the number of objects as `2`

```python
Employee.objects.all().count()
```

- To create an `Employee` model object, run below command

  ```python
  e = Employee(firstName='John', lastName='Bailey', salary=10000)
  ```

  - Now to save this `Employee` model object into the database, use `save()` emthod which is inherited by every `Model` object which inherits it from its parent model, and that will create a record in the database

  ```python
  e.save()
  ```

- After you've run `save()` method command, now check the count of `Employee` model objects using the command below which should show an increased count as `3`

```python
Employee.objects.all().count()
```

- You can double-check by going to the database in MySQL workbench
- The second way is to use the `Model.objects.create()` method, which even returns the `Employee` model object indicating the `id` of the new `Employee` model object as `4`

  ```python
  Employee.objects.create(firstName='Bob', lastName='Bailey', salary=20000)
  ```

  - If you want to check the count of `Employee` objects, you can do that, and it should return `4`

  ```python
  Employee.objects.all().count()
  ```

- There are two ways in which you can create records or create Model objects
  1. first is by creating an object for the model class and invoking the `save()` method
  2. second on is using `Model.objects.create()` method and passing the data to it

## 062. Bulk Create
