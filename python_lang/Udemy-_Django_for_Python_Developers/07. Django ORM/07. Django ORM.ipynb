        "- When you used `empApp.models.Employee.objects.all()` in `views.py` file, you got a list of employees from the database which is nothing but Django ORM (Object Relational Mapping) in action, so without writing any SQL queries you got the employees' records\n",
        "- In this and the next few lectures, we're going to explore the Django ORM in detail\n",
        "- To do that, we don't have to work in the IDE, can learn all that from the shell or the command-line\n",
        "  - Goto your terminal/command-line, make sure you're under `djangoprojects/modelDemo` project, once you're in that directory, open a python shell with DJango support inside it using below command\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```bash\n",
        "  python manage.py shell\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - First step is to import the Model class `Employee`, all the Django libraries are available for us but we simply need to import them\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  from empApp.models import Employee\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Once the model `Employee` is imported, you can do all kinds of operations here, now create a `Query Set` which will contain all the records from the database using the method `Employee.objects.all()`\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  qs = Employee.objects.all()\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",

        "  print(type(qs))\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - If you want only one record at a time, you'll use `Employee.objects.get(id=1)` method with `id=1` as its primary key, and it'll return only one record as a `Employee` model object\n",

        "  print(emp)\n",
