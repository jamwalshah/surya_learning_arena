# 10. CRUD using Function Based Views

## 095. Hands on Steps

- In the next few lectures, you'll be performing the CRUD operations against the `student` table in the database
- You'll be creating a model called `student`, you'll `Read` all the students from the database, you'll display that on the `homepage` of your application
- The end-user can add a new user by clicking on a `Add Student` link, give the `FirstName`, `LastName` and the `TestScore`, click on `Save`, this'll make a database `save`, so we'll be using Django ORM in our views to do that save
- We'll also allow the end-user to `Update` and existing records and also `Delete` that record by simply clicking on the `Delete` button

## 096. Create the Project

- In this lecture, we'll create the project, the Model and the form
- To do that, goto the command-line/terminal, make sure that you're under the projects directory `djangoprojects`, create a new project `fbvCRUD` using command below, `fbvCRUD` stands for CRUD operations using Function-Based Views

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject fbvCRUD
  ```

- Now change directory into `fbvCRUD`

  ```bash
  cd fbvCRUD
  ```

- Now create an app `fbvApp` in it

  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp fbvApp
  ```

- Now, go grab the project folder `djangoprojects/fbvCRUD` and open it in your IDE
- Goto the `settings.py` file, search for `INSTALLED_APPS` property, add the app `fbvApp` here

  ```python
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'fbvApp',
  ]
  ```

- You can start by creating the `templates` folder under the `djangoprojects/fbvCRUD` project folder
- Goto `settings.py` file, search for `TEMPLATES` properties and add the path to the `templates` folder

  ```python
  TEMPLATES = [
      {
          'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
          'DIRS': ['templates', ],
          'APP_DIRS': True,
          'OPTIONS': {
              'context_processors': [
                  'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                  'django.template.context_processors.request',
                  'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                  'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
              ],
          },
      },
  ]
  ```

- You can create the Model and the form now, open the app `fbvApp` folder and open the `models.py` file, and make changes in it as below, make sure that you specify a `max_length` attribute to a `CharField()`

  ```python
  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Student(models.Model):
      """Model definition for Student."""
      firstName = models.CharField(max_length=20)
      lastName = models.CharField(max_length=20)
      testScore = models.FloatField()
  ```

- Next, create a file `fbvApp/forms.py` and open it, then modify it as per code below to create a form

  ```python
  from fbvApp.models import Student
  from django import forms

  class StudentForm(forms.ModelForm):
      """Form definition for Student."""

      class Meta:
          """Meta definition for Studentform."""
          model = Student
          fields = '__all__'
  ```

- So, in this lecture, you've created a project, created an app, you've then created a mode for the Student with three fields, you've then used that model to create a form based off that model, and within that form you're mentioning which model should this form be based on & also the fields where we're including all the fields in that model

## 097. Implement READ

- In this lecture, we'll create the view and the template that'll display all the student information
- To do that, goto `views.py` file, and add a view `getStudents(request)` as per code below

  ```python
  from django.shortcuts import render
  from fbvApp.models import Student

  # Create your views here.
  def getStudents(request):
      students = Student.objects.all()
      return render(request, 'fbvApp/index.html', {'students':students})
  ```

- Next, we'll create a template, under the `templates` directory, add a new folder `fbvApp`, and within this folder `templates/fbvApp` add a template file `index.html`

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Student Information</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in students %}
                  <tr>
                      <td>{{ student.id }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- We're going to touch this again, we'll provide some links here for updating and deleting each student, but for now we're displaying all the student information

## 098. Run the Migrations

- In this lecture, we'll configure the database and also the URLs for our application, and also do the migrations so that we can start testing it
- Goto `settings.py` where we'll configure the database information for our application, search for `DATABASES` property, and modify the databases information as per below code snippet

  ```python
  DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
          'NAME': 'studentdb',
          'USER': 'root',
          'PASSWORD': 'mysql',
      }
  }
  ```

- Now goto MySQL Workbench, and run the command below which will create a new database

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE studentdb;
  ```

- Now currently we don't have any tables inside this database, but we can switch to this database so that we can start using it

  ```sql
  USE studentdb;
  ```

- Now, go to the command-line/terminal, and we'll do the migrations using the command below which will generate the SQL code for us in the `0001_initial.py` file

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```

- Now do do the migrations using the command below which will create all the tables for us

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- Now go back to the MySQL Workbench, run the command below t list out all the `auth_*` tables , `django_*` tables etc., and at the end of it, it has `fbvapp_student` is our app table

  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES;
  ```

- Now run the command below, it'll give you empty list

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM fbvapp_student;
  ```

- Now, lets also configure the URLS so that we can test our application in next lecture, goto `urls.py` and modify the `urlpatterns` list as per code snippet below

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from fbvApp import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('', views.getStudents),
  ]
  ```

- So, in this lecture we have configured the database, we've done the migrations and we've also configured a URL for our view

## 099. Test READ

- We're all set to test our application
- To do that, goto the command-line/terminal, make sure that you're under the project directory `djangoprojects/fbvCRUD`
- Run the command below which will start the Django server, doesn't mean that all the syntax is correct, if there are any syntactical errors, we'll fix that

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

- Goto the web-browser, visit the URL at `localhost:8000`, it'll show no records right now

- Goto the MySQL Workbench, Lets insert a record using command below

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO fbvapp_student VALUES (1, 'John', 'Feguson', 90);
  ```

- Now that we have one record in database, goto web-browser and refresh the URL at `localhost:8000`, so the data cones back
- You can insert more records, we'll do that through the UI by creating a view and the functionality for `CREATE` operation in the next lecture

## 100. Implement Create

- Next of the CRUD operations is the `CREATE` operation
- To do that, open `views.py` file and lets implement a view `createStudent(request)`

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from fbvApp.models import Student
from fbvApp.forms import StudentForm

# Create your views here.
def getStudents(request):
    students = Student.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'fbvApp/index.html', {'students':students})

def createStudent(request):
    form = StudentForm()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = StudentForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
        return redirect('/')
    return render(request, 'fbvApp/create.html', {'form':form})
```

- So, this will be rendered when the user accesses the page for the first time, it'll not have any data
  - When user enters data and hits `Submit` button, we're going to handle that request using the `StudentForm(request.post)` after checking if request method is POST or not, then save the form after checking if form is valid or not
  - After the form is saved, we'll redirect it to the index/home page where all the students are displayed instead of staying on the same form using `django.shortcuts.redirect()`
- So, you've successfully implemented the `createStudent(request)` view
- Next, create a template which is super-easy, add anew template file for it as `templates/fbvApp/create.html` and modify it as per code below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Create Student</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h2>Create Student</h2>
          <form method="post">
              <table>
                  {{ form.as_table }}
                  {% csrf_token %}
              </table>
              <br/>
              <input type="submit" value="Save">
          </form>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- In this lecture, you've implemented the view as well as the form, thus implemented the Create operation, and we'll test it in the next lecture

## 101. Test Create

- In this lecture, we'll test the create functionality
- Goto `urls.py`, add a path to `createStudent` view

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from fbvApp import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('', views.getStudents),
      path('create/', views.createStudent),
  ]
  ```

- Now goto `index.html` template, and we'll add a link so that user will click on that link to add a student, modify this template as per code below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Student Information</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in students %}
                  <tr>
                      <td>{{ student.id }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- Now that Django server is already running, open web-browser and visit the URL at `localhost:8000`, along with the student data table now you can see an `Add Student` link, click on that link, that should take you to the nice form
  - Lets enter the data here and hit save, it'll return to the index/homepage and it displays the new record too, so it saves the data to the database, it fetches the data from the database and renders it on the homepage
  - We're being redirected to the index/home page because we have used `redirect()` in the code after saving the data to the database in the view

## 102. Delete

- In this lecture, we'll implement the Delete operation which is a little more tricky as compared to Read and Create
- Goto your IDE, open `views.py`, define a new view `deleteStudent(request, id)` that takes a `request` and and `id` of the student, we fetch that student, then on that model object we invoke the `.delete()` method that executes a delete query to delete from the database and then we're redirecting to the index/home page

  ```python
  from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
  from fbvApp.models import Student
  from fbvApp.forms import StudentForm

  # Create your views here.
  def getStudents(request):
      students = Student.objects.all()
      return render(request, 'fbvApp/index.html', {'students':students})

  def createStudent(request):
      form = StudentForm()
      if request.method == 'POST':
          form = StudentForm(request.POST)
          if form.is_valid():
              form.save()
          return redirect('/')
      return render(request, 'fbvApp/create.html', {'form':form})

  def deleteStudent(request, id):
      student = Student.objects.get(id=id)
      student.delete()
      return redirect('/')
  ```

- Now, lets configure the URL for it, open the `urls.py` file, add a path for `deleteStudent` view in `urlpatterns`

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from fbvApp import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('', views.getStudents),
      path('create/', views.createStudent),
      path('delete/<int:id>', views.deleteStudent),
  ]
  ```

- Now goto `index.html` template, for every table row we're providing a link, on clicking of that link we're passing the `student.id` that comes with the student information when it is being fetched and `/delete/` is the URL

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Student Information</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in students %}
                  <tr>
                      <td>{{ student.id }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore }}</td>
                      <td><a href="/delete/{{ student.id }}">Delete</a></td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- Now that Django server is already running, goto the web-browser and visit/refresh the URL at `localhost:8000`, click on `Delete` link for any record, and that should be gone
- So `Delete` link deletes the data from the database and it goes back to the index/home page which will render the data again, if you want to double check, goto the MySQL Workbench, run the query below and you should see only one record

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM fbvapp_student;
  ```

- In this lecture, you've successfully implemented the Delete operation which takes a request and an id, and then in the URL configuration, `delete/<int:id>` is one way of configuring the URLs in which we specify the type of the `id` in the placeholder

## 103. Update View

- In this and the next lecture, we'll perform the Update operation, the last of the CRUD operations
- To do that, Lets start where we've left
- In the `index.html`, lets start with a new link for Update, so on each record if the user wants to update the data, user should see an Update link for each of them

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Student Information</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in students %}
                  <tr>
                      <td>{{ student.id }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore }}</td>
                      <td><a href="/delete/{{ student.id }}">Delete</a></td>
                      <td><a href="/update/{{ student.id }}">Update</a></td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- So if the user clicks on the `Update` link, it should come to a view `updateStudent(request, id)`, one we fetch the student with the `id` fields, we need to send it to the UI which will render it to a form on `fbvApp/update.html` template so that the user can do the Updates
- So far its pretty straight forward, you're getting the student from the database and we're sending it to a form that will render it so that user can update it, and when he hits the update or save button we need to have a logic similar to the `createStudent(request)` view
- Now that data for that `student` is being fetched from the database, we handle the request that we have from the `Update` template, so the form will be created as `StudentForm` to update the data to be set onto the `student` model instance from the `POST` request that we have
- If you're updating only one field, other fields in the model should not be lost, so you're taking the data from the database into a Model instance `student`, and you're taking the data from the `POST` request that comes from the UI, setting the values from the `POST` request onto the `student` object and that goes into the form
- Next, similar to `createStudent` view, we validate that form, and use the `.save()` function to commit the values from the form to the database, and then redirect to the index/Home page using `redirect('/')`

  ```python
  from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
  from fbvApp.models import Student
  from fbvApp.forms import StudentForm

  # Create your views here.
  def getStudents(request):
      students = Student.objects.all()
      return render(request, 'fbvApp/index.html', {'students':students})

  def createStudent(request):
      form = StudentForm()
      if request.method == 'POST':
          form = StudentForm(request.POST)
          if form.is_valid():
              form.save()
          return redirect('/')
      return render(request, 'fbvApp/create.html', {'form':form})

  def deleteStudent(request, id):
      student = Student.objects.get(id=id)
      student.delete()
      return redirect('/')

  def updateStudent(request, id):
      student = Student.objects.get(id=id)
      if request.method == 'POST':
          form = StudentForm(data=request.post, instance=student)
          if form.is_valid():
              form.save()
              return redirect('/')
      return render(request, 'fbvApp/update.html', {'student':student})
  ```

## 104. Update Template

- The next step is to create a `update.html`
- Create a new template file as `templates/fbvApp/update.html`
- In this file we need to be more involved as we'll create a form inside the template html file, instead of using a Django form, instructor will show how to use a Django form later on

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Update Student</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h2>Update Student</h2>
          <form method="post">
              {% csrf_token %}
              First Name: <input type="text" name="firstName" value={{student.firstName}}><br/>
              Last Name: <input type="text" name="lastName" value={{student.lastName}}><br/>
              Test Score: <input type="text" name="testScore" value={{student.testScore}}><br/>
              <input type="submit" value="Update">
          </form>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- In this lecture, you've successfully created a form manually, instead of a Django form, because there is no straight forward way of using a Django form, there is an additional step which instructor will show later on

## 105. Test Update

- In this lecture, we'll configure the URLs and test the update operation
- Goto `urls.py` file, add another path for `updateStudent` view

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from fbvApp import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('', views.getStudents),
      path('create/', views.createStudent),
      path('delete/<int:id>', views.deleteStudent),
      path('update/<int:id>', views.updateStudent),
  ]
  ```

- Goto terminal/command-line and make sure that Django server is running without errors after saving these updates
- Go back to the web-browser and refresh the URL at `localhost:8000`, there we'll see an update button too against each of the record in the table
  - Now click on `Update` button to see if that works, it'll load an update form, notice the URL for this update form, it has an id being used in url `http://localhost:8000/update/1` which fetches the data from the database and renders it in the UI in the form
  - Now change the `Test Score` to `95` and hit update, and we see the new test score on the index/home page
- Now that we have all the CRUD operations here in this app
  - Now add a student, enter the values in the Create Student form and hit `Save` button, this record will be added so you can see it as you'll be redirected to the index/home page
  - You can now delete the first record and it'll be gone as you click on Delete link
  - Now update the one record that is remaining, set the `Test Score` as `90` and click on `Update` button, so this record will be updated

## 106. Using Django form for Update

- When we have implemented the Update operation in ``views.py` file, we're fetching the student data and we're sending back the student data instead of a Django form and in the `update.html` template, we have to manually create the form because we're not getting a Django form that has student data, instead we're getting a student object and we're getting the fields on our own
- We can easily change that and implement it using a Django form like we've implemented in Create operation, open the `views.py` file, and modify it as below

  ```python
  def updateStudent(request, id):
      student = Student.objects.get(id=id)
      form = StudentForm(instance=student)
      if request.method == 'POST':
          form = StudentForm(request.POST, instance=student)
          if form.is_valid():
              form.save()
              return redirect('/')
      return render(request, 'fbvApp/update.html', {'form':form})
  ```

- a `student` model instance is used to populate the Model form using form constructor `StudentForm(instance=student)` and that constructor object is later used as context to render the update student view using `render()` with a Django Model form

- Open the `update.html` template file and modify it as per code below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Update Student</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h2>Update Student</h2>
          <form method="post">
              {% csrf_token %}
              <table>
                  {{ form.as_table }}
              </table>
              <input type="submit" value="Update">
          </form>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- Instructor wanted you to understand how you can retrieve the values, how you can create the forms on your own and also you need to create a Form object based off the data/model object that is coming from the database as an additional step
- Go back to the browser, refresh the URL at `localhost:8000`, click on the update link, you can see the form update/working, change the `TestScore` to `70`, click on `Update` button and the score is changed to 70
- So you need to take two steps
  1. In `views.py` file, Create a Django Model Form using the Student data/Model object as instance, Use the form object in dictionary instead of sending the student data/Model object as context to the `render()` method
  2. In the `Update.html` template file, simply use the form object with `.as_table` Django template tag, remember it should go in a `<table>` tag

## Assignment 6 : CRUD Using FBV

- As an assignment for the `fbvCRUD` section, instructor wants you to
  - create a Model called `Course` which will have
    - `name` like Java Web-services, or Django
    - `description`of the course
    - `instructor` indicating who is teaching that course
    - `rating` indicating the rating given by the students
  - Create this model and perform the CRUD operation `C`reate, `R`ead, `U`pdate and `D`elete using Function-Based Views
