# 10. CRUD using Function Based Views

## 095. Hands on Steps

- In the next few lectures, you'll be performing the CRUD operations against the `student` table in the database
- You'll be creating a model called `student`, you'll `Read` all the students from the database, you'll display that on the `homepage` of your application
- The end-user can add a new user by clicking on a `Add Student` link, give the `FirstName`, `LastName` and the `TestScore`, click on `Save`, this'll make a database `save`, so we'll be using Django ORM in our views to do that save
- We'll also allow the end-user to `Update` and existing records and also `Delete` that record by simply clicking on the `Delete` button

## 096. Create the Project

- In this lecture, we'll create the project, the Model and the form
- To do that, goto the command-line/terminal, make sure that you're under the projects directory `djangoprojects`, create a new project `fbvCRUD` using command below, `fbvCRUD` stands for CRUD operations using Function-Based Views

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject fbvCRUD
  ```

- Now change directory into `fbvCRUD`

  ```bash
  cd fbvCRUD
  ```

- Now create an app `fbvApp` in it

  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp fbvApp
  ```

- Now, go grab the project folder `djangoprojects/fbvCRUD` and open it in your IDE
- Goto the `settings.py` file, search for `INSTALLED_APPS` property, add the app `fbvApp` here

  ```python
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'fbvApp',
  ]
  ```

- You can start by creating the `templates` folder under the `djangoprojects/fbvCRUD` project folder
- Goto `settings.py` file, search for `TEMPLATES` properties and add the path to the `templates` folder

  ```python
  TEMPLATES = [
      {
          'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
          'DIRS': ['templates', ],
          'APP_DIRS': True,
          'OPTIONS': {
              'context_processors': [
                  'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                  'django.template.context_processors.request',
                  'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                  'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
              ],
          },
      },
  ]
  ```

- You can create the Model and the form now, open the app `fbvApp` folder and open the `models.py` file, and make changes in it as below, make sure that you specify a `max_length` attribute to a `CharField()`

  ```python
  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Student(models.Model):
      """Model definition for Student."""
      firstName = models.CharField(max_length=20)
      lastName = models.CharField(max_length=20)
      testScore = models.FloatField()
  ```

- Next, create a file `fbvApp/forms.py` and open it, then modify it as per code below to create a form

  ```python
  from fbvApp.models import Student
  from django import forms

  class StudentForm(forms.ModelForm):
      """Form definition for Student."""

      class Meta:
          """Meta definition for Studentform."""
          model = Student
          fields = '__all__'
  ```

- So, in this lecture, you've created a project, created an app, you've then created a mode for the Student with three fields, you've then used that model to create a form based off that model, and within that form you're mentioning which model should this form be based on & also the fields where we're including all the fields in that model
