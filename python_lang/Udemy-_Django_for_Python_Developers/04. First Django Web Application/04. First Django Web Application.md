# 04. First Django Web Application

## 018. Create a Django Project

- You'll `Create` your very first Django project using the django-admin command-line utility
- To do that, go to your command-line on windows or terminal on mac/linux
- Go to the directory where you want to create a folder where you want to save all your Django projects

``` bash
mkdir djangoprojects
```

- once you have that folder, go into that folder

``` bash
cd djangoprojects
```

and use command

``` bash
django-admin startproject firstProject
django-admin startproject <ProjectName> # syntax
```

to create the projects, applications, etc.

- `startproject` is the option to create a project
- You may use command

``` bash
ls
```

to check the newly created project

- Now open the file explorer to locate the project folder `firstProject` which you've created just now, and drag-drop this folder in an IDE of your choice to open it as a project
- This Project folder has the following files
  1. `__init__.py`
      - it is an empty file
      - it tells the python that this folder is a package
  2. `settings.py`
      - As the name suggests, it contains all
      - the settings/configurations for the applications inside this project,
      - the middleware configuration that you'll be doing later on
      - the database configuration
      - Here you can see the installed apps list
      - when you create an application inside this project later on, you'll add that app in `INSTALLED_APPS`
      - You can also see the middleware configuration under `MIDDLEWARE`
      - You can also find `TEMPLATES`, `WSGI_APPLICATION`
      - it shows `sqlite3` in `DATABASES` as it comes with python3, when you create your application later on, it'll have sqlite in-memory database of its own
      - You can also point to MySql or Oracle by changing the configuration to the appropriate database as required
      - By default, Django projects come with sqlite database
  3. `urls.py`
      - As the name itself says, this is the file that carries the URL patterns of our projects as well as applications
      - We'll be creating several web-pages or views in our applications, each of those web-pages will have a URI that we've to configure here
      - Django comes with an in-built admin tool, so you can see `admin/` url which points to the `admin.site.urls` that Django provides
      - It also has a lot of documentation available at the top which you can read
      - You'll be learning how to configure URLs, how to use regular expressions inside them in lectures later on
  4. `wsgi.py`
      - **WSGI** stands for Web Server Gateway Interface
      - This file can be used to deploy our applications to online servers or even to the cloud
      - Typically, we use this during production deployments
  5. `manage.py`
      - we rarely mess with this file, but we'll be using this file every time we run our project, every time we run migrations for our projects once we start working with databases
      - we'll be using manage.py from the command-line / terminal to run our projects, run applications, run database migrations, and more

## 019. Run the Project

- You'll run your very first project
- To do that, goto command-line or terminal, then goto the directory of the project
- Once you're inside the project directory, make sure that you have `manage.py`, you'll need this file in order to run our project or even migrations later on
- Use the command

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

which will run our Django application

- It'll run Django application using `settings.py` file, starting development server on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` using port `8000`
- Django provides a default web-server for us and it'll launch our application on the web-server
- You may launch your web-browser, and open the URL `localhost:8000`, and you'll see the default Django application, which has references to Django documentation, Tutorial, Django Community, and more
- It'll show message as `The install worked successfully! Congratulations! You are seeing this page because DEBUG=True is in your settings file and you have not configured any URLs.`, which is fine as we have not touched any development part
- To stop this server, come to the command-line and hit `Ctrl+C`
- Notice the previous line, it logs all the incoming requests on the command line
- To run this Django server on a different port, you may run

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver 7777
python3 manage.py runserver <PortNumber> # syntax

```

- Now you need to visit the Django server on new port instead of default port in the web-browser

## 020. Create a Django App

- The next step is to `Create a Django Application` inside the `Django Project` that we've created
- Go to the command-line, stop the Django Server, make sure you're under the project directory
- To create a Django application, you need to run command

```bash
python3 manage.py startapp firstApp
python3 manage.py startapp <AppName> # syntax
```

- Now, the project directory has a folder named `firstApp`, which you can check using command

```bash
ls
```

- You may also goto your IDE to check the folder for app
- A Python Project can comprise of many applications, inside which we'll be creating models, views, etc.
- Lets go through important files here, we'll come back to migrations later on when we deal with databases

1. `__init__py`
    - a blank file with this name indicates that current folder is a python package
2. `admin.py`
    - we can register our modules in the applications inside this file and Django will use these modules with the Django admin interface
    - Django provides an administrative interface, and if you want to make the parts of your application into a part of admin interface, you can include those here, which  will be shown later on
3. `apps.py`
    - In this file, we can store all the application specific configuration
4. `models.py`
    - This is where we'll be storing our data models
    - WHatever data models we have in this file will represent the database tables pretty much
    - we'll work on these models later on, each model will have several properties inside them
    - we'll talk more about it when we'll deal with models
5. `tests.py`
    - In this file, we have application specific tests
    - For every function and class, we create the respective tests here
6. `views.py`
    - it is also one important file we'll touch in the next few lectures
    - In this file, we'll be saving all the functions or the classes that'll handle the incoming requests from the user/web-browser
    - When a request comes in, it comes from a particular view and that view will respond with an output, which will be displayed on the browser
    - So, Views is where all the HTML mode and python code lives which is responsible for rendering the UI (User Interface)

- `migrations` directory
  - This directory stores all the database specific information related to our models
  - models and views are the most important files here
  - You'll also be creating a URLs.py later on for your particular application

## 021. Create a view

- Next step is to configure our application inside the `settings.py` which is the project configuration
- in `settings.py` file, if you scroll down, you'll see all the installed apps in `INSTALLED_APPS` list
  - at the end of this list, after the comma, within single quotes, you've to specify the application name, which is `'firstApp'`
  - This tells Django that there is an Application called `firstApp` which is a part of this project
  - When this project is run, this new app should be included
  
  ```python
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'firstApp',
    ]
  ```

- Now, goto `views.py` inside `firstApp`, and you're going to create your very first view
- There are two ways in which you can create views
  1. Class-based views
  2. Function-based views
- We'll start with Function-based views, and later on we'll discuss the Class-based views

> A view is responsible for taking a request, and sending a response back

- The very first step is to import the `HttpResponse` from `Django.http`

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
```

- In Django, we'll take the incoming HTTP request whatever the browser sends when the user clicks a button, clicks on a link, etc., the incoming request will be wrapped inside an object and that object will be handed over to the method inside our view
- Now you create a function `display` which takes a request and returns a response, Every view takes a request and returns a HttpResponse back, whatever you'll return using the HttpResponse object will go back to the browser

```python
def display(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>My First Django App !!</h1>")
```

- In the next lecture, we'll configure the URL for this view so that we can run our application and see this in action

## 022. Configure URLs and Run the App

- The next step is to configure a URL to the view that we have created and run our application and test it
- The name of the view is `display()` function inside our `views.py module`
- To configure a URL to this view, goto the `urls.py` file under our project
- You already see a couple of imports here

1. we have the `admin` interface from `django.contrib` that django provides, we'll be shown later on

    ``` python
    from django.contrib import admin
    ```

2. we have the `path` from `django.urls`, using which we can configure a URL for a particular view

    ``` python
    from django.urls import path
    ```

- In `urlpatterns` list, we already have a path for the admin URL to the admin view
  - Here, add another item to the list as `path()` function call by passing the URI you want for the particular view as the `route`, and the full name of the `view` (first import the `views` from the `firstApp` application into this `urls.py` file)

  ```python
  from firstApp import views
  urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('hello/', views.display),
  ]
  ```

- Save it, go to your command-line to run the application, make sure you're under the `firstProject` directory which has the `manage.py`
- run command, and it'll run the application on port 8000

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

- launch your web-browser and open `localhost:8000/hello`, which is the URL you should use, and you'll see the response coming back
- So, the request from web-browser will go to the Django server and in the command-line you'll see response coming back for the `GET` request to `/hello/` route
- When a request comes from the web-browser, it'll look for the URL/route that comes within the request and it knows from `urls.py` file that this URL/route is mapped to which view, so it'll execute that particular view from the `views.py` file, and whatever the `HttpResponse` that view returns will be sent back to the browser, which is what you're seeing in the browser

## 023. Create another view

- The `views.py` file hosts any number of views that're required for our application
- In this lecture, you'll create another view that will return the current server's date and time, when user accesses it
- In `views.py` file, lets first start with the import

```python
import datetime
```

- then define a new view `displayDateTime(request)` which receives the request from the client and it should return the `datetime`
  - then store the current `datetime` as returned by `now()` function, and then convert it into a string while appending some text to it
  - and in last statement of the view, you return the new string, which will be sent as response back to the browser

```python
def displayDateTime(request):
    dt = datetime.datetime.now()
    s = "<b>Current Date and Time: </b>"+str(dt)
return HttpResponse(content=s)
```

- The next step is to map this view to a URL, goto `urls.py`, add `path()` function call with new route `datetime/` and its view as `views.displayDateTime`

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('hello/', views.display),
    path('datetime/', views.displayDateTime),
]
```

- save the `urls.py` file and automatically your changes will be picked up, and it'll restart the server which is the beauty of the inbuilt Django server
- Now go to the browser, instead of `localhost:8000/hello/`, we should use `localhost:8000/datetime/`, hit enter and then you'll see the recent view's response which shows the current date and time

## 024. Multiple applications in a project

- So far, we have only one application inside this project, but as the project size grows, our code will be spread across applications within a project in real-time
- In this lecture, you'll learn how to create another application within this project
- Goto terminal or command-line, stop the server
- You know th command to create an application which you've used earlier, you can bring that back using up arrow or you can type it

```bash
python3 manage.py startapp quoteApp
python3 manage.py startapp <AppName> # syntax
```

- Lets say this app will return a quotation or a quote when the user requests for it
- Hit enter, and we have the new `quoteApp`
- If you go back to your IDE, we should see the quote app right there
- Now, go directly to the `views.py`, you don't have to worry about the rest of the files, and here we're going to create a new view that will return a quote back to the end-user
- define a view using function `displayQuote()` that takes a request, and returns an `HttpResponse` object with our quote as a string being passed to it, but we first need to import the `HttpResponse` from `django.http`

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
def displayQuote(request):
    return HttpResponse("The best investment we can make is in ourself")
```

- Now, goto `settings.py` of our project, and register the app under `INSTALLED_APPS` list by adding the name of the app in single quotes

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'firstApp',
    'quoteApp',
]
```

- Now, goto `urls.py` of our project, you'll need to import views from `quoteApp`
  - Now, our application has views from `quoteApp` as well as `firstApp`, so it confuses compiler that which views we're referring to
  - So, we import views from each app as an alias

  ```python
  from firstApp import views as fa
  from quoteApp import views as qa
  ```
  
  - Now, we'll define a new `urlpattern` using `path()` function which takes the route/URL and the view's full name

  ```python
  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('hello/', fa.display),
      path('datetime/', fa.displayDateTime),
      path('quote', qa.displayQuote),
  ]
  ```

- Now, goto the command-line or terminal, start the server using command

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

hit enter, if everything goes okay, you'll see the proper response in the web-browser

- Now, go back to the web-browser, previous URLs should work, so visit `localhost:8000/datetime/` and `localhost:8000/hello/`
  - Lets try the new URL `localhost:8000/quote`, which will show the quote added as plain text without any HTML formatting
  - You may add some HTML tags such as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.
- Now, our project hosts multiple applications and you've also used a new view within the new application in the `urls/py` of the project
- Alternatively, in `urls.py`, you may import the function from views directly as

```python
from firstApp.views import display
from firstApp.views import displayDateTime
from quoteApp.views import displayQuote
```

and `urlpatterns` will be defined without any alias instead by directly using imported functions

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('hello/', display),
    path('datetime/', displayDateTime),
    path('quote', displayQuote),
]
```

and save it to auto-reload the application

- All these import of views will go away in next few lectures as you'll learn that each application can have its own `urls.py` file

## 025. Application level URLs

- A project is modularized into multiple applications which are `firstApp` and the `quoteApp`, with their own views
- But, the `urls.py` is still the same
- On the project level, we have a single `urls.py` file that hosts everything
- We can have app-level `urls.py` instead that will promote reusability, and then we can use these applications across projects instead of tying these apps URLs in project-level `urls.py`
- We need to move these application specific URLs to the app-level
- Lets do that by copying the project-level `urls.py`, paste it in 'firstApp' as well as 'quoteApp'
- Now, goto 'firstApp' directory, open the `urls.py`, and within this file, we'll define only the URLs that are specific to this application
  - You can remove the 'admin' import, as we already have that at the project-level, and we can also remove the view from 'quoteApp'

  ```python
  from django.urls import path
  from firstApp.views import display
  from firstApp.views import displayDateTime
  ```

  - And, you can do the same for the `path()` function in `urlpatterns` list, as we only need the 'firstApp' related paths here
  
  ```python
  urlpatterns = [
      path('hello/', display),
      path('datetime/', displayDateTime),
  ]
  ```

- Do the same for the 'quoteApp' also, goto the 'quoteApp' directory, open its `urls.py`
  - remove the two imports from 'firstApp', and remove the view from 'admin' as well

  ```python
  from django.urls import path
  from quoteApp.views import displayQuote
  ```

  - in `urlpatterns`, there'll be only one `path()` function call, get rid of the first three URLs, and keep the URL related to 'quoteApp'

  ```python
  urlpatterns = [
      path('quote', displayQuote),
  ]
  ```

- Now, you've to go back to the project-level `urls.py` file, remove the imports from 'firstApp' as well as 'quoteApp', and their respective three URL routes in `urlpatterns`
  - we'll import the import/include the `urls.py` directly into project-level `urls.py` for each app

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from django.conf.urls import include
  ```

  - In `urlpatterns` list, append the `path()` function call with route as `firstApp/` and include view using function `include('firstApp.urls')` available in `django.conf.urls`
  - This `include()` function will automatically include `firstApp.urls.py` inside our project-level `urls.py`
  - Now, add another `path()` function with route as `quoteApp` and include its view using `include('quoteApp.urls')` in a similar way

  ```python
  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path(route='firstApp/', view=include('firstApp.urls')),
      path(route='quoteApp/', view=include('quoteApp.urls')),
  ]
  ```

- Now, restart the server, or it should've already reloaded everything, but just to make sure, restart the server, and run it again using

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

- Now, go back to the web-browser, the URLs will have changed slightly
  - Now, we have application-specific information, so we should specify the URL by specifying the application name then the view name such as `localhost/firstApp/hello` , `localhost:8000/quoteApp/quote` and
- Here, the application-level is specified such as 'firstApp' or 'quoteApp' in the URL, is mapped to the application using the `urls.py` file which we have at the project-level, so it'll refer to the project-level `urls.py` file which has a `path()` function specified in the `urlpatterns` list, then it'll refer to the view at the application-level using the `urls.py` at the application-level, which is specified in the `include()` function passed as view to the `path()` in project-level `urls.py` file

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path(route='firstApp/', view=include('firstApp.urls')),
    path(route='quoteApp/', view=include('quoteApp.urls')),
]
```

- The beauty is that every application has its own `urls.py` file and Django resolves the URL by referring to the project-level `urls.py` and then it refers to application-level `urls.py` to display the content in the referred view

## 026. Using Python Virtual Environment

- In this lecture, we'll se how to use the python virtual environment to create and manage your project dependencies
- The reason we need python virtual environment is that, if we have multiple projects which are using, say `mysqlclient` library/package, then we'll have to install it using below command, and this command will install the latest version of `mysqlclient`

  ```bash
  pip3 install mysqlclient
  ```

- Consider a situation, what if one of the project needs a certain version say `v1.8` and another project needs the latest version, then we'll have a problem because above command will install `mysqlclient` **globally** , one version gets over-ridden with another, and we'll have all the conflicts and all the issues
- This is where python virtual environment comes in, it allows us to have separate virtual environments for different projects or a group of projects
- We can have virtual environment for each of the project we create or we can have a virtual environment for all the projects in one place, it is up to us how we organize it
- Th e beauty is that we can separate out the dependencies for a particular project and it'll not conflict with the global dependencies or the dependencies of the other projects
- Launch your web-browser, and search for 'python virtual environment', scroll-down and go the page which says 'Installing packages using pip and virtual environments' with link [packaging.python.org](packaging.python.org)
  - Everything is explained in detail here
  - To use the python virtual environment, minimum commands which you need are listed in the file you may see at the resources section of this lecture
  - The first command is to install virtual environment package, which is also listed in the documentation at the web-page which was pointed out earlier, goto the command line and execute it
  
  ```bash
  pip3 install virtualenv
  ```
  
  - Once we have the virtual environment, we can create the virtual environment using command
  
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env
  ```
  
  - Before we go ahead and run the above command, if you execute this command, it'll show you where that virtual environment is installed on your machine
  
  ```bash
  which virtualenv
  ```
  
  - To create a virtual environment, use below command with any name of environment you want, it'll create an environment with its own python folder, etc.
  
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env # UNIX/Linux
  python3 -m venv <nameOfEnv> # syntax UNIX/Linux
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  py -m venv env # Windows
  py -m venv env # Syntax Windows
  ```
  
  - Once environment is created, goto your projects folder `djangoprojects`, you'll see the folder `env`, go inside it, it has following folders
      1. `bin` or `activate`
        - python has `bin` and windows has `activate` folder
        - it has `pip3` folder and `python` pointing to python already installed on the machine
        - it has `activate` file which is executed when you run command to activate a virtual environment
      2. `include`
      3. `lib`
        - it currently has `python3.x`, which got automatically because it is the same python already installed on the machine
        - it has folder `site-packages` which has all the packages for your project
        - whenever you activate this environment, whatever packages are available in this site-packages will be available for your project
  - So far, we have created the virtual environment, and if we execute below command, it still points to the global python directory, not the virtual environment python, so you'll see the global installation paths
  
  ```bash
  which python3 # UNIX/Linux
  where.exe python # Windows
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  which pip3 # UNIX/Linux
  where.exe pip # Windows
  ```
  
  - To activate or to use a particular virtual environment, you've to activate it using below command, paste this command in terminal/cmd, then hit enter and you'll see on the left of the command-line, it indicates the name of virtual environment folder you've activated
  
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate # UNIX/Linux
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  env\Scripts\activate # Windows
  ```
  
  - Now that virtual environment is activated, if you run `which` or `where` command for python path or pip path, it'll show the path from the virtual environment
  
  ```bash
  which python3 # UNIX/Linux
  where.exe python # Windows
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  which pip3 # UNIX/Linux
  where.exe pip # Windows
  ```
  
  - Now, if you install any python package using `pip3` or `pip`, it'll install them here only in this virtual environment, now install `django`
  
  ```bash
  pip3 install django
  ```
  
  - Once it finishes installation, you'll see `django` available for use in the virtual environment folder `env`, go into it, open `lib`, open `site-packages`, there you'll see `django`
  - Now install another package `mysqlclient` only in this virtual environment
  
  ```bash
  pip3 install mysqlclient
  ```
  
  - Once a virtual environment is activated, all those dependencies will eb available for those projects, thats the beauty of virtual environment
  - Lets, create a simple Django project, you can copy the below command, and run it to create a project named `virtualEnvDemo`
  
  ``` bash
  env/bin/django-admin.py startproject virtualEnvDemo
  env/bin/django-admin.py startproject <projectName> # syntax UNIX/Linux
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  env\Scripts\django-admin.exe startproject virtualEnvDemo
  env\Scripts\django-admin.exe start project <projectName> # syntax Windows
  ```
  
  - `env/bin/django-admin.py` or `env\Scripts\django-admin.py` is the path where `django-admin` is installed
  - If you want to do migrations (which you'll learn later), you can run this command, it'll do the migrations for you, but make sure you're already in the project directory which you've already created previously
  
  ```bash
  python3 manage.py migrate # UNIX/Linux
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  python manage.py migrate # Windows
  ```
  
  - Similarly, If I run the below command in project directory, it'll run the django server on port 8000 and we can access it on `localhost:8000`, only difference is that this time we have used a virtual environment
  
  ```bash
  python3 manage.py runserver # UNIX/Linux
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  python manage.py runserver # Windows
  ```
  
  - It'll help us in having local dependencies or packages and resolve any conflicts with other projects
  - So, going forward, you can create a virtual environment and you can use that for all the Django projects that you'll be using throughout the course, so that it'll not conflict with whatever you have globally on your machine
  - If you want to deactivate a virtual environment, first you'll shut down the running Django server using `Ctrl+C`, and then enter below command
  
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```
  
  - After deactivating virtual environment, if you try to check the paths for python or pip, it'll show the global installation paths
  
  ```bash
  which python3 # UNIX/Linux
  where.exe python # Windows
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  which pip3 # UNIX/Linux
  where.exe pip # Windows
  ```
  
  - If you want to delete the virtual environment, simply remove the folder by deleting it
  
  ```bash
  rm -rf env
  ```
  
  ```cmd
  rmdir /s env
  ```

- You can create any number of virtual environments you want, and when you create & activate a virtual environment, whatever you do inside that virtual environment, all those packages will be local to that environment, and it'll not conflict with any other virtual environment or the global installations which you have
