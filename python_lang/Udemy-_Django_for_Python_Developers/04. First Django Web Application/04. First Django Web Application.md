# 04. First Django Web Application

## 018. Create a Django Project

- You'll `Create` your very first Django project using the django-admin command-line utility
- To do that, go to your command-line on windows or terminal on mac/linux
- Go to the directory where you want to create a folder where you want to save all your Django projects

``` bash
mkdir djangoprojects
```

- once you have that folder, go into that folder

``` bash
cd djangoprojects
```

and use command

``` bash
django-admin startproject firstProject
django-admin startproject <ProjectName> # syntax
```

to create the projects, applications, etc.

- `startproject` is the option to create a project
- You may use command

``` bash
ls
```

to check the newly created project

- Now open the file explorer to locate the project folder `firstProject` which you've created just now, and drag-drop this folder in an IDE of your choice to open it as a project
- This Project folder has the following files
  1. `__init__.py`
      - it is an empty file
      - it tells the python that this folder is a package
  2. `settings.py`
      - As the name suggests, it contains all
      - the settings/configurations for the applications inside this project,
      - the middleware configuration that you'll be doing later on
      - the database configuration
      - Here you can see the installed apps list
      - when you create an application inside this project later on, you'll add that app in `INSTALLED_APPS`
      - You can also see the middleware configuration under `MIDDLEWARE`
      - You can also find `TEMPLATES`, `WSGI_APPLICATION`
      - it shows `sqlite3` in `DATABASES` as it comes with python3, when you create your application later on, it'll have sqlite in-memory database of its own
      - You can also point to MySql or Oracle by changing the configuration to the appropriate database as required
      - By default, Django projects come with sqlite database
  3. `urls.py`
      - As the name itself says, this is the file that carries the URL patterns of our projects as well as applications
      - We'll be creating several web-pages or views in our applications, each of those web-pages will have a URI that we've to configure here
      - Django comes with an in-built admin tool, so you can see `admin/` url which points to the `admin.site.urls` that Django provides
      - It also has a lot of documentation available at the top which you can read
      - You'll be learning how to configure URLs, how to use regular expressions inside them in lectures later on
  4. `wsgi.py`
      - **WSGI** stands for Web Server Gateway Interface
      - This file can be used to deploy our applications to online servers or even to the cloud
      - Typically, we use this during production deployments
  5. `manage.py`
      - we rarely mess with this file, but we'll be using this file every time we run our project, every time we run migrations for our projects once we start working with databases
      - we'll be using manage.py from the command-line / terminal to run our projects, run applications, run database migrations, and more

## 019. Run the Project

- You'll run your very first project
- To do that, goto command-line or terminal, then goto the directory of the project
- Once you're inside the project directory, make sure that you have `manage.py`, you'll need this file in order to run our project or even migrations later on
- Use the command

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

which will run our Django application

- It'll run Django application using `settings.py` file, starting development server on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` using port `8000`
- Django provides a default web-server for us and it'll launch our application on the web-server
- You may launch your web-browser, and open the URL `localhost:8000`, and you'll see the default Django application, which has references to Django documentation, Tutorial, Django Community, and more
- It'll show message as `The install worked successfully! Congratulations! You are seeing this page because DEBUG=True is in your settings file and you have not configured any URLs.`, which is fine as we have not touched any development part
- To stop this server, come to the command-line and hit `Ctrl+C`
- Notice the previous line, it logs all the incoming requests on the command line
- To run this Django server on a different port, you may run 

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver 7777
python3 manage.py runserver <PortNumber> # syntax

```

- Now you need to visit the Django server on new port instead of default port in the web-browser

## 020. Create a Django App

- The next step is to `Create a Django Application` inside the `Django Project` that we've created
- Go to the command-line, stop the Django Server, make sure you're under the project directory
- To create a Django application, you need to run command

```bash
python3 manage.py startapp firstApp
python3 manage.py startapp <AppName> # syntax
```

- Now, the project directory has a folder named `firstApp`, which you can check using command

```bash
ls
```

- You may also goto your IDE to check the folder for app
- A Python Project can comprise of many applications, inside which we'll be creating models, views, etc.
- Lets go through important files here, we'll come back to migrations later on when we deal with databases
