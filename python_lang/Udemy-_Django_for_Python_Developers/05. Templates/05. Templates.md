# 05. Templates

## 027. Introduction

- When you've been introduced to the MVT (Model View Template) pattern that django uses, you've been told that `Template` is the component that is responsible for the UI to the end user, which is nothing but rendering the HTML to the browser
- In this section, you're going to learn how to create templates, because templates are not just HTML, but also dynamic
- These can take the data that view sends to them and these can render that dynamically to the end-user
- You'll learn how to to do that using Template tags
- We'll also learn how to use static content like images, style sheets, etc. inside your templates while working with django

## 028. Hands on Steps

- In the next few lectures, you'll see templates in action
  - You'll start by developing a very simple template which will render the text "Templates in Action from MVT !!"
  - You'll then learn how to pass your name to the web-browser to the template from the view
  - You'll then develop a little more sophisticated template, where you'll display the employee information on the UI, you'll also render a beautiful image on to that web-browser
- You're going to do all that in very simple steps
  - You'll create a project and an application
  - Create a templates directory and configure it in settings.py
  - Create a template itself, which is an HTML page with some special tags that you're going to learn
  - Create a view that'll render / use that template, and also pass map of data to the template from the web
  - We'll then configure the URLs and then see the Templates in action
  - In this process, we'll learn some super-cool tags that you can use inside the template
  - We'll also learn how to include static files like images, style sheets, etc. inside your HTML templates
- Also you'll develop a small project where you'll be displaying the various categories of products, its like a small e-Commerce project, where you'll display electronic products, toys, shoes
  - When the User clicks on one of these links, the products under those categories will be displayed

## 029. Create the Project with Template Settings

- In this lecture, we'll create a new Django project with an application inside it, and we'll set it up, so that we can use templates within that project
- To do that, go to your terminal/command-line, make sure you're under the `djangoprojects` directory, and create a new project using below command, hit enter and it'll create a new project named `templateDemo` for us

```bash
django-admin startproject templatesDemo
```

- Go into the project directory using below command

```bash
cd templatesDemo
```

- and create an app `templatesApp` here using below command

```bash
python3 manage.py startapp templatesApp
```

- The next step is to create a templates folder within our project using below command

```bash
mkdir templates
```

- `templates` folder is where all our templates will be stored, and within this folder, for each application there will be a separate folder
  - Go into `templates` folder, and create a folder `templatesApp`

  ```bash
  cd templates
  mkdir templatesApp
  ```

  - The next step is to setup this templates folder in the project, we'll do that by going to file explorer and open the `templatesDemo` project in your IDE, and open the `settings.py` of your project, and you'll see that it already includes the import for `os` and it has a base directory `BASE_DIR` which points to the project directory
    - All we need to to do is to go to directories `DIRS`, scroll down to the `TEMPLATES` list, here in templates, it has a property called `DIRS` as a list, which is where we should add our directory, as `os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`, and `templates` is the directory name which we created earlier to store templates

    ```python
    import os
    TEMPLATES = [
        {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
              'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
          },
        },
    ]
    ```

  - the `BASE_DIR` point to the project folder `templatesDemo`, which is what either of these return

  ```python
  from pathlib import Path
  BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
  ```

  ```python
  import os
  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
  ```

- Now, we have configured the templates directory, so that django knows where to find the templates
