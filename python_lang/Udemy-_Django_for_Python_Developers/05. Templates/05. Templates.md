# 05. Templates

## 027. Introduction

- When you've been introduced to the MVT (Model View Template) pattern that django uses, you've been told that `Template` is the component that is responsible for the UI to the end user, which is nothing but rendering the HTML to the browser
- In this section, you're going to learn how to create templates, because templates are not just HTML, but also dynamic
- These can take the data that view sends to them and these can render that dynamically to the end-user
- You'll learn how to to do that using Template tags
- We'll also learn how to use static content like images, style sheets, etc. inside your templates while working with django

## 028. Hands on Steps

- In the next few lectures, you'll see templates in action
  - You'll start by developing a very simple template which will render the text "Templates in Action from MVT !!"
  - You'll then learn how to pass your name to the web-browser to the template from the view
  - You'll then develop a little more sophisticated template, where you'll display the employee information on the UI, you'll also render a beautiful image on to that web-browser
- You're going to do all that in very simple steps
  - You'll create a project and an application
  - Create a templates directory and configure it in settings.py
  - Create a template itself, which is an HTML page with some special tags that you're going to learn
  - Create a view that'll render / use that template, and also pass map of data to the template from the web
  - We'll then configure the URLs and then see the Templates in action
  - In this process, we'll learn some super-cool tags that you can use inside the template
  - We'll also learn how to include static files like images, style sheets, etc. inside your HTML templates
- Also you'll develop a small project where you'll be displaying the various categories of products, its like a small e-Commerce project, where you'll display electronic products, toys, shoes
  - When the User clicks on one of these links, the products under those categories will be displayed
