        "- In this section, you're going to learn how to create templates, because templates are not just HTML, but also dynamic\n",
        "- These can take the data that view sends to them and these can render that dynamically to the end-user\n",
        "- You'll learn how to to do that using Template tags\n",
        "- We'll also learn how to use static content like images, style sheets, etc. inside your templates while working woth django\n"

        "- In the next few lectures, you'll see templates in action\n",
        "  - You'll start by developing a very simple template which will render the text \"Templates in Action from MVT !!\"\n",
        "  - You'll then learn how to pass your name to the web-browser to the template from the view\n",
        "  - You'll then develop a little more sophisticated template, where you'll display the employee information on the UI, you'll also render a beautiful image on to that web-browser\n",
        "- You're going to do all that in very simple steps\n",
        "  - You'll create a project and an application\n",
        "  - Create a templates directory and configure it in settings.py\n",
        "  - Create a template itself, which is an HTML page with some special tags that you're going to learn\n",
        "  - Create a view that'll render / use that template, and also pass map of data to the template from the web\n",
        "  - We'll then configure the URLs and then see the Templates in action\n",
        "  - In this process, we'll learn some super-cool tags that you can use inside the template\n",
        "  - We'll also learn how to include static files like images, style sheets, etc. inside your HTML templates\n",
        "- Also you'll develop a small project where you'll be displaying the various categories of products, its like a small e-Commerce project, where you'll display electronic products, toys, shoes\n",
        "  - When the User clicks on one of these links, the products under those categories will be displayed\n"
