# 12. More about Templates

## 119. Use Template Inheritance on CBV

- In this lecture, you'll apply your template inheritance knowledge to the `cbvCRUD` project
- Open the project `cbvCRUD`, open folder for `cbvApp`, open `templates`, open any of the templates, and notice that all of these templates have some part common, at the start, and at the end
- This application doesn;t have a `header` where we're displaying manu and a `footer` where it has links to various things, but these templates have a common start and a common end
- So we can move this common functionality into a base template
  - Create a new template `cbvApp/templates/cbvApp/base.html`, and get the HTML boilerplate code, and inside the `<body>` tags, we put a Django block template tag `{% block body_block %}...{% endblock %}` , so the child classes can use these blocks and come up with whatever code they have
  - Modify `base.html` as per snipppet below

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            {% block body_block %}
            {% endblock %}
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

- Now Lets open a child template file, open `student_confirm_delete.html`, remove the common portion before `<body>` tag, use the `{% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}` template tag to import the base template file, and then wrap the uncommon child snippet into `{% block body_block %} ... {% endblock %}` template tags, as shown below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  {% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}
  {% block body_block %}
          <h2>Delete Student {{ student.firstName }} ?</h2>
          <form method="post">
              <input type="submit" value="Confirm">
              <a href="/{{ student.id }}">Cancel</a>
              {% csrf_token %}
          </form>
  {% endblock %}
  ```

- Repeat the same process for other template files as well
- Modify `student_form.html` template as below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  {% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}
  {% block body_block %}
          <h1>Create Student</h1>
          <form method="post">
              {{ form.as_p }}
              {% csrf_token %}
              <input type="submit" value="Save">
          </form>
  {% endblock %}
  ```

- Modify `student_detail.html` template as below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  {% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}
  {% block body_block %}
          <h1>Student Details</h1>
          <ol>
              <h3><li>First Name: {{ student.firstName }}</li></h3>
              <h3><li>Last Name: {{ student.lastName }}</li></h3>
              <h3><li>Test Score: {{ student.testScore }}</li></h3>
              <h3><li><a href="/delete/{{ student.id }}">Delete</a></li></h3>
              <h3><li><a href="/update/{{ student.id }}">Update</a></li></h3>
          </ol>
  {% endblock %}
  ```

- Modify `student_list.html` template as below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  {% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}
  {% block body_block %}
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in student_list %}
                  <tr>
                      <td><a href="/{{ student.id }}">{{ student.id }}</a></td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
  {% endblock %}
  ```

- Now goto the project directory `djangoprojects\cbvCRUD`, and run the command below to run the Django server

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

- Now open the web-browser and visit the URL at `localshost:8000/students`, and it still works as expected, but we're reusing a lot of stuff
- So, everything goes into the the parent template which is `base.html`, and the child template inherited from the parent template, whatever snippet specific to child template is put into the `{% block block_name %}...{% endblock %}` template tag

## 120. Filters in Action

- In this lecture, you'll learn how easy it is to apply filters to your templates
- To do that, goto the `student_list.html`, and if you open this template using `localhost:8000/students` URL, You can see that First Name column has names in Title case, and to show all names in lower case, we need to add filter `lower` in the `student_list_html` template file as under

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  {% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}
  {% block body_block %}
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in student_list %}
                  <tr>
                      <td><a href="/{{ student.id }}">{{ student.id }}</a></td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName | lower }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
  {% endblock %}
  ```

- Go back to the web-browser, refresh the URL at `localhost:8000/students`, and you'll see all the values in First Name column in lower case
- Similarly, we can work with numeric values, dates, there are several filters that we can use
- To use numeric filter to add `2` extra marks, we can use `add` filter with `testScore` as below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  {% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}
  {% block body_block %}
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in student_list %}
                  <tr>
                      <td><a href="/{{ student.id }}">{{ student.id }}</a></td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName | lower }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore |add:'2' }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
  {% endblock %}
  ```

- To see the exhaustive list of filters, open web-browser, and search for `built in Django filters` in Google, open the link with title `Built in  template tags and filters`
- Later on when we'll be working on real-time projects, we'll use some of these filters, until then go through these filters and use some of them on strings and numbers

## 121. User Defined Filters

- In this lecture, you'll learn how to create your own filters, i.e., custom filters
- Earlier, we've used the `lower` filter, which will display or render the data in lower case, but if you want only certain characters within the First Name, lets say the first three characters to be lower case, you can accomplish it using your own filters
- Once you learn how to create a custom filter, you can apply whatever logic within that filter
- Go to the App level `cbvApp`, the very step is to create a flder called `templatetags` under your app folder, this is where all our custom filter modules will live
  - You can make it a package by creating a file `cbvApp/templatetags/__init__.py`, which is just an empty init file
- Create a new file `cbvApp/templatetags/custFilters.py`, this file name could be anything, this is where all our custom filters will live, this is a module that we're going to develop
  - First step is to import `template` from `django`
  - And the next step is to create an instance of `template.Library()` to store into variable called `register`, which will make it a valid tag library
  - Now we can create any number of filters by simply defining functions for each filter
  - we'll create a custom filter `custLower(value)` that takes a `value` from the runtime, just before the `|` after which this custom filter will be used, anc it will convert only the first three characters, and return the result which will be rendered
  - After defining a custom filter, we need to register the custom filter using the instance of template libarary into `register`
  - Modify `cbvApp/templatetags/custFilters.py` as below

    ```python
    from django import template
    register = template.Library()

    def custLower(value):
        result = value[:3].lower()
        return result

    register.filter('myLower', custLower)
    ```

- So that's how you create custom filters
- First you need to create a folder called `templatetags` under your application directory, then you'll create a `__init__.py` so that this folder will become a package, and then you'll create your own `custFilter.py` module, and within that module, you import the `template` library from `django`, then the next line is to create an instance of that template library and assign it to a variable called `register` which will confirm that this module is a custom rag library or custom filter library, then you can define as many number of filters as you want by simply creating functions and those functions will receive values which we can can play around with, then return a result you want, and at the end, you need to register all your filters using the library instance `register` and a `filter(name='myLower', filter_func=custLower)` function in it by spacifying the name of the filter which will be used in the template and the function name
- In the next lecture, we'll test this and we'll another way to register your filters

## 122. Using Custom Filter

- In the previous lecture, you've created a `custLower` filter function that will take the first three characters of a given string and converts them into lowercase, and returns it
- We'll use this in the `student_list.html` in two simple steps
- The first step is to load the custom filters module using`{% load custFilters %}` template tag, we have to spcify the file name into this load template tag
- Once you load the module, you can use the `myLower` filter, we'll use it with `student.lastname` field, just like we used the `lower` filter, we now use the registered name of custom filter, not the name of the function it calls

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  {% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}
  {% block body_block %}
  {% load custFilters %}
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in student_list %}
                  <tr>
                      <td><a href="/{{ student.id }}">{{ student.id }}</a></td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName | lower }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName | myLower }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore |add:'2' }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
  {% endblock %}
  ```

- Now, goto the web-browser, and reload the URL at `localhost:8000/students` and you'll see only the first three characters in lower case for Last Name column
- If you're seeing ay errors here that it couldn;t find the `custFilter` module etc., go restart your Django server

## 123. Registering a Filter using a decorator

- In this lecture you'll learn another easy way to register your filter
- In `custFilter.py`, instead of using the `register.filter('myLower', custLower)` to register the custom filter, you can get rid of it and use a decorator `@register.filter(name='myLower')` just above the function that you've defined

  ```python
  from django import template
  register = template.Library()

  @register.filter(name='myLower')
  def custLower(value):
      result = value[:3].lower()
      return result
  ```

- Goto web-browser and refresh the URL at `localhost:8000/students`, and it should still work the same, there shouldn't be any changes in the Last Name column, because we just changed the way we register the custom filter

## 124. Passing Arguments

- In this lecture, you'll learn how to pass the arguments or parameters to the filters you create
- Earlier when you'd used the in-built filters `add:"2"`, you've seen that you can pass arguments to the `add` filter, separated by `:`
- To receive these arguments, within our `custFilters.py` file, you can start adding `args`, so that it becomes the first argument and so on
- Lets create another custom filter

  ```python
  from django import template
  register = template.Library()

  @register.filter(name='myLower')
  def custLower(value):
      result = value[:3].lower()
      return result

  @register.filter(name='myAppend')
  def custAppend(value, arg):
      result = str(arg) + value
      return result
  ```

- Lets use this `myAppend` on `student_list.html` at the `student.firstname` field

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  {% extends "cbvApp/base.html" %}
  {% block body_block %}
  {% load custFilters %}
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in student_list %}
                  <tr>
                      <td><a href="/{{ student.id }}">{{ student.id }}</a></td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName | myAppend:"Mr. " }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName | myLower }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore |add:'2' }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
  {% endblock %}
  ```

- Go back to the web-browser, refresh the URL at `localhost:8000/students`, and you'll see the updated First Name column
- The key here is that you've learnt how to pass in a parameter or an argument to your custom filters, which will be the second parameter to your filter function, and we can use it and do whatever we want inside it, and in the template itself, to pass a value use `filtername:"argument"`
