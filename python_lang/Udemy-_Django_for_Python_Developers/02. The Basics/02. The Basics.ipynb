        "  - for example,\n",
        "    - When you're accessing Udemy, the Udemy developers have already developed a web application, and they've deployed it onto a `Web Server`, that can be accessed from a `Web Client`\n",
        "    - So your browser sends a request to the server on which Udemy is running, and then the server will run the appropriate resources to serve your request, then server takes the response and send it back to you (web Client)\n",
        "- The communication between a web client and a web server takes place using the HTTP\n",
        "- `HTTP` stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol\n",
        "  - it is a set of rules that makes it easy and the web client & web server should follow in order to communicate\n",
        "- As web client follows HTTP, it can be called as HTTP client\n",
        "- Examples of web-servers are Apache and IIS\n",
        "- Examples of web-clients/web-browsers are Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.\n",
        "- You can also develop a HTTP client in any programming language of your choice using the API it provides\n",
        "- Popular websites or Popular web-applications include Google, facebook, twitter and bharaththiippireddy.com which is course creator's website\n",

        "    - followed by a domain name or the server name, such as `udemy.com`\n",
        "    - followed by a port number, such as `80`, but we rarely specify a port number explicitly because port 80 is the default port on which most of the web-servers run or port 80 is the default port for HTTP\n",
        "      - Even if you don't specify any port number, web-browsers will by default connect on port 80\n",
        "      - Web-Servers run by default on port 80, and web-browsers connect to the port 80 and then ask for the resources\n"
