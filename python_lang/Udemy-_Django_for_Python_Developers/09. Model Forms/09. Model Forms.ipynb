        "- And we need not specify all the fields from scratch, we simply use a `Meta` class and tell Django which Model, this form should be based off, for example `model = Employee`, and on that Model we can optionally specify the fields we want to include, weather you want to include all the fields `fields = '__all__'` or only some of the fields which you can do using a list\n",
        "- The advantage here is that we can directly take the data that comes from this form, and save it to the database because we have a link from this form to the  Model and to the database\n",
