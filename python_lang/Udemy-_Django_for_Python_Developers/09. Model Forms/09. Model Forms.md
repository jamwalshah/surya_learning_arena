# 09. Model Forms

## 081. Introduction

- In this section, you'll be learning how to use Model based forms
- Model based forms make our life so much easier, because we develop the form based on a particular Model class we've already created
- So, you'll create a class called `MyForm` or whatever name, which will inherit `forms.ModelForm` this time
- And we need not specify all the fields from scratch, we simply use a `Meta` class and tell Django which Model, this form should be based off, for example `model = Employee`, and on that Model we can optionally specify the fields we want to include, weather you want to include all the fields `fields = '__all__'` or only some of the fields which you can do using a list
- The advantage here is that we can directly take the data that comes from this form, and save it to the database because we have a link from this form to the  Model and to the database
- So our work as a developer is lot more easier if we use Model forms

## 082. Hands On Steps

- In the next few lectures, we'll be creating Model based forms
- To do that, you'll
  1. first `Create a Model` object
  2. then `Create the Form` of the Model object, once you have the Model, you need not repeat all those fields in the form, you can use a meta class and tell that we want to use all the fields from that Model
  3. then `Create the View` which will render the form as well as this view is responsible for processing the data once the form is submitted and even save the data to the database
  4. we'll also `Create the HTML templates`
  5. `Configure the URLs and Test` our application
- The Model we're going to work on is a Project, it could be a roadwork, it could be a software project, which will have `startDate`, `endDate`, `name`, `assignedTo` and `priority`
- The home page will display two links
  1. `List Project`
  2. `Add Project`
- When clicked on `Add Project`, it'll go to the form that you'll be creating, this form is based on the Model class we'll be creating, we'll have all the fields from the Model, you can add the project details in the form, and once we submit it, it'll submit to the database
- Then we can look at all the projects by clicking on the `List Projects` link, and it'll display all the projects in the database to the end-user as an HTML table

## 083. Create the project and model

- The first step is to create a Project and create a Model within that project called `Project`
- The `Project` Model should have the following fields, `startDate`, `endDate`, `name`, `assignedTo` and `priority`
- Goto your command-line/terminal, make sure you're under the project's directory `djangoprojects`, and create a new project using the command below

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject modelFormsDemo
  ```

- change directory into that project `modelFormsDemo` using command below

  ```bash
  cd modelFormsDemo
  ```

- Once you're in there, use the command below to create an app `modelForms`

  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp modelForms
  ```

- Grab your project and open it in your IDE
- Now, create a folder named `templates` in the project directory `djangoprojects\modelFormsDemo`
- Now, goto `settings.py` and lets do the templates, search for `TEMPLATES` property and add the templates directory to the `DIRS` in it

  ```python
  TEMPLATES = [
      {
          'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
          'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],
          'APP_DIRS': True,
          'OPTIONS': {
              'context_processors': [
                  'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                  'django.template.context_processors.request',
                  'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                  'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
              ],
          },
      },
  ]
  ```

- Now goto `models.py` and Lets create a model class `Project(models.Model)` there

  ```python
  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Project(models.Model):
      startDate = models.DateField()
      endDate  = models.DateField()
      name = models.CharField()
      assignedTo = models.CharField()
      priority = models.IntegerField()
      
  ```

- In this lecture, we've created a project set it to use templates, and also, you've created the model for it which has 5 fields

## 084. Create the Model form

- The next step is to create a form using the Model which we've already developed
- Now goto app `ModelForms`, and create a new file in it called `forms.py` which is where our forms will live
  - In `forms.py`, create a Model class `ProjectForm(forms.ModelForm)`, which has a class `Meta`
  - Now you need to import your Model class `Project` from `modelForms.models`
  - Inside `Meta` class, specify the `model` as your model class `Project`, `fields` will be set to `__all__` which tells Django that we want to include all the fields from our Model class `Project`
  - You can also include only some of the fields, or we can exclude some of the fields, we'll show you later on once we run this project

    ```python
    from django import forms
    from modelForms.models import Project

    class ProjectForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = Project
            fields = '__all__'
    ```

- In this lecture, we have learnt how to create a Model form by inheriting your form class from `forms.ModelForm`, inside that you create a `Meta` class as an inner class which tells Django which model should be used in this form and also the fields that should be included from that Model

## 085. Create the Views

- In this lecture you'll start creating the views for our application
- There are three different views
  1. `index.html` : is responsible for rendering the index page which is the starting point of our application, and in this page there will be options for the end user with two links which are the other two views
  2. `listProjects.html` : first link on index page will render this view which is responsible for rendering this template that will list all the projects in the database
  3. `addProject.html` : second link on index page will render third view which is where end-user can add a project to the database, this is where we're using the form that we've created
- Goto your IDE, we'll create a couple of views in this lecture, and the third one in the next lecture
- Open `views.py`, and first import `ProjectForm` from `modelForms.forms` and `Project` from `modelForms.models`
  - Now create a view function for the first view as `index(request)` which will render the template `modelForms/index.html`
  - Create view function for another view as `listProjects(request)` which will first fetch all the records/projects from the database, and then render it to template `modelForms/listProjects.html`

    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from modelForms.forms import ProjectForm
    from modelForms.models import Project

    # Create your views here.
    def index(request):
        return render(request, 'modelForms/index.html')

    def listProjects(request):
        projectsList = Project.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'modelForms/listProjects.html', {'projects':projectsList})
    ```

- So, in this lecture, we've successfully created two different view, the `index(request)` view which is responsible for rendering the `index.html` template, and the `listProjects(request)` view that will retrieve all the projects from the database and it'll send it to a template `listProjects.html`

## 086. Create the Add Project View

- The last view is the `addProject` view, this is a little more involved compared with other views, as this is where we are going to use the form that we've created
- Create a view function `addProject(request)` which will render the form `ProjectForm` that we've created to the template `modelForms/AddProject.html`
  - Once we submit the submit button, we have to handle the form using the `request` object, we check if the method of request is `POST`, then we check, if the `request.POST` that form has sent is valid or not using `form.is_valid()`, and if found valid we use `form.save()` method to save the changes in the model because this form is a Model form which inherits the `forms.ModelForm`
  - and at the end of this view, we'll return the `index(request)` view by passing it the request, which is exactly how we navigate from one UI/view to another view
  - So when the user finishes submitting the form, instead of going back to the same form, we can goto the index page where the user can select among the options to list the projects or add a project here

    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from modelForms.forms import ProjectForm
    from modelForms.models import Project

    # Create your views here.
    def index(request):
        return render(request, 'modelForms/index.html')

    def listProjects(request):
        projectsList = Project.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'modelForms/listProjects.html', {'projects':projectsList})

    def addProject(request):
        form = ProjectForm()
        if request.method == 'POST':
            form = ProjectForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                form.save()
            return index(request=request)
        return render(request, 'modelForms/AddProject.html', {'form':form})
    ```

- In this lecture, we've successfully created a `addProject(request)` view that takes a request, `ProjectForm` is the form that we initially displayed to the user, once he enters the data we're handling the data using the POST request `request.POST` that comes in and if the request method `request.method` is POST, then we're getting the form that has all the data from the POST request `request.POST`, then we're validating the form request `form.is_valid()`, then we're saving the form request data `form` by invoking the `form.save()`, and then we're returning the user to the `index(request)` view

## 087. Create the Index Template

- In this lecture, we'll start creating the templates or the HTML pages
- To do that, goto the `templates` directory and create a new folder under it named `modelForms`
- Now create the first template file `index.html` in `djangoprojects/modelFormsDemo/templates/modelForms` directory
- Now open this `templates/modelForms/index.html` file, and modify it as per below code to add two links to other two templates

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Projects</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <a href="/listProjects">List Projects</a><br/>
          <a href="/addProject">Add Project</a>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- So this is the first template

## 088. Create the List Projects Template

- The second template that we're going to create is the `listProjects.html`
- Goto the `templates/modelForms` directory and create a new template file `listProjects.html` in `djangoprojects/modelFormsDemo/templates/modelForms` directory
- Now open this `templates/modelForms/listProjects.html` file, and modify it as per below code

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Projects List</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          {% if projects %}
          <table>
              <thead>
                  <th>Name</th>
                  <th>Start Date</th>
                  <th>End Date</th>
                  <th>Assigned To</th>
                  <th>Priority</th>
              </thead>
              {% for project in projects %}
                  <tr>
                      <td>{{ project.name }}</td>
                      <td>{{ project.startDate }}</td>
                      <td>{{ project.endDate }}</td>
                      <td>{{ project.assignedTo }}</td>
                      <td>{{ project.priority }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          {% else %}
          <p>No Projects Found</p>
          {% endif %}
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- So, we've created a template for listing the projects, within which we're checking if the `projects` exist from the data/view, if there are projects then we're rendering it in a table, along with that we're using Django `for` template tag to render one row per record in the database, otherwise if we don't have any projects from the view, we'll display a message for no projects found

## 089. Create the Add Project Template

- The last template is the `addProject.html`
- Before we move ahead, make sure that this `listProjects.html` template is under the `templates/modelForms` directory, not under directly `templates`, otherwise, move this file to `templates/modelForms`
- Goto the `templates/modelForms` directory and create a new template file `addProject.html` in `djangoprojects/modelFormsDemo/templates/modelForms` directory
- Now open this `templates/modelForms/addProjects.html` file, and modify it as per below code

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Add Project</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Add Project:</h1>
          <form method="post">
              {{ form.as_p }}
              {% csrf_token %}
              <input type="submit" value="Add Project">
          </form>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

## 090. Configure URLs

- The last step is to configure the URLs for our views
- Start doing that by opening the `urls.py` file, and modify the file as shown below to add paths to the three views `index`, `listProjects` & `addProject`

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from modelForms import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('', views.index), # empty route means root path of app
      path('listProjects/', views.listProjects),
      path('addProject/', views.addProject),
  ]
  ```

- So, we've configured all the three URLs successfully

## 091. Configure MySQL

- In this lecture, you'll setup MySQL database for your project
- To do that, you can refer to `ModelDemo` project that you've worked on earlier
- Goto MySQL WOrkbench or your MySQL client
  - Run below command to create the database and we have the `projectdb` setup
  
  ```SQL
  CREATE DATABASE projectdb;
  ```
  
- Go back to our project in IDE, open `modelFormsDemo` project and open the `settings.py` file, search for property `DATABASES`, set the `ENGINE` to `django.db.backends.mysql`, `NAME` as `projectdb`, and other credentials of database

  ```python
  DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
          'NAME': 'projectdb',
          'USER': 'root',
          'PASSWORD': 'mysql',
      }
  }
  ```

- Now, if you want to make sure the database configuration is okay, you can always goto command-line under you project where it has `manage.py` file and run the below command which will open an interactive shell

    ```bash
    python manage.py shell
    ```

  - Now in the python interactive shell, run the commands below, and if the second command runs without any error, it means our project has good database configuration to connect and work with MySQL

    ```python
    from django.db import connection
    c = connection.cursor()
    ```

## 092. Run Migrations

- In this lecture, we'll run the migrations for our project, which will create the database tables
- Before, we do that, in `settings.py`, search for `INSTALLED_APPS` property, make sure the app is appended here which is `modelForms`

  ```python
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'modelForms',
  ]
  ```

- Now goto the command-line/terminal, if you're inside the python interactive shell, hit `Ctrl+D` to come out of it, and then run the command below

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```
  
  - If it shows error, make sure that all the `CharField` items in model should have `max_length` defined, so goto `models.py` file and make changes in the model class

    ```python
    class Project(models.Model):
        startDate = models.DateField()
        endDate  = models.DateField()
        name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        assignedTo = models.CharField(max_length=20)
        priority = models.IntegerField()
    ```
  
  - Now run the migrations again using command below, which will create `0001_initial.py`

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```

- Once `makemigrations` command is successful, run the command below which will create the database for us

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- Now got to the database in MySQL Workbench
  - Run command below to change the database to `projectdb`

    ```sql
    USE projectdb;
    ```

  - Run command below to list all the tables in `projectdb` database

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```

  - We have all tables along with our application table `modelforms_project`
  - Now `SELECT` all records from our app table `modelforms_project`

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM modelforms_project;
    ```

  - Right now, this table does not have any records, the `id` column is added by Django, besides other columns form Model class

## 093. Refactor and Run the Application

- In this lecture, we'll see our application in action
- Before we do that there are a few little things that we need to fix
  1. first thing is to make sure that the `templates` folder is spelled correctly, which instructor has spelled as `tempaltes` instead of `templates`
  2. second, in the `listProjects.html` template, make sure that Django template tags are used correctly, which instructor has used `<% for project in projects %>` instead of correct tags as `{% for project in projects %}`
  3. In the `views.py` file, make sure Model objects are fetched correctly, instructor has mis-typed `projectsList = Project.objectrs.all()` instead of correct one as `projectsList = Project.objects.all()`
  4. In the `views.py` file, make sure that HttpRequest object is referred correctly, instructor has mis-typed `if form.method == 'POST':` instead of correct one `if request.method == 'POST':`
  5. In the `views.py` file, make sure that Form object is referred correctly, instructor has mis-typed `form = MovieForm(request.POST)` instead of correct one as `form = ProjectForm(request.POST)`
- Now goto command-line/terminal, and run the command below to run the Django server for this project and the application starts

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

- Open the web-browser and visit the URL at `localhost:8000/`, and the index page shows two links as expected
  - Click on the `List Projects` link, and it should show `No Projects Found` message because there is no data in the database
  - Go back, click on `Add Project` and it should display the form
  - Now enter the data in the form, dates in the format `MM/DD/YYYY`, enter name as `Clinical Data Reporting`, assigned to `John`, priority is `1`, and then click on `Add Project` button and it should return to index page upon successful form submission
- Lets see if the data is available in the database now, open the MySQL Workbench, and run the `SELECT` query as shown below, and we can see the data

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM modelforms_project;
  ```

- Go back to the web-browser, open the `List Projects` Link, it'll show all the data right there
  - You can display this data as a table as well, or as a list item `<li>` or a paragraph `<p>`
- You can play around here, but the key is that you're able to add a project and able to list projects along with details as well

## 094. Django tables from migrate

- When you run the migrate command, along with our application table, there were a lot of other tables that got created, some of these tables have `auth_` prefix and some have `django_` prefix
  1. `auth_` prefix stands for authentication and authorization, so tables with prefix `auth_` are for security, so Django has in-built security and it'll use these tables internally to provide security, we'll learn about these when we get there
      - `auth_user` stores the user information using which our clients can login
      - `auth_group` is the user group, a user can be assigned to multiple groups, and those groups can have permissions
      - `auth_permission` stores the permission to groups to which user belong to, and that will tell what data in our application the user has access to, authorization comes in right there
      - `auth_group_permissions` is a mapping table for group and permissions
      - `auth_user_groups` is a mapping for user and groups
      - `auth_user_user_permissions` is a mapping for user and permissions
  2. `django_` prefix tables
      - `django_admin_log`: Django comes with an administration application for all the web-applications that we can use and all those logs can be stored in this table
      - `django_content_type` is used by Django content type applications, to see this, goto your project in IDE, open `settings.py` file, in `INSTALLED_APPS` property, it has an app `django.contrib.contenttypes` that comes with Django and these are added to all the projects, it provides a generic view of all the models that you create in `models.py` file, you can create a UI and then access the models through that UI, this `django.contrib.contenttypes` app uses the other two tables `django_migrations` and `django_session` to store its information
      - `django_migrations` is used by Django to store all the migration related information that it needs to perform migrations, different versions of migrations that we perform
      - `django_session`: When we do Django session management, you'll see that DJango uses this table internally to store all the session related data
- We need not worry about all these tables because we don't directly use that but Django uses them and you should know what Django uses them for
- So these are all the tables that get created other than the application tables, Django creates all these for internal usage

## Assignment 5 : Model Forms

- As an assignment for the Mode Forms section, instructor wants you to
  - create a model called `Movie` which will have
    - `name`
    - `releaseDate` is of type `DateField`
    - `rating`
  - Once you create the model, you'll follow the following steps
    - Create a Model
    - Create a Model based form
    - Create the view
    - Create a templates for it
    - Configure the URLs
    - Do the migrations
    - test the application
  - You're going to perform a list operation where you'll list all the movies in the database
    - display all the movies to the end user
    - give user an option/link using which he can add a new movie to the existing movies

### Solution

#### Create the Project

- First goto the project directory `djangoprojects`, launch terminal/command-line
- Now create a Django project here named `movieProject` using command below

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject movieProject
  ```

- Then start virtual environment using command below

  ```bash
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- Goto Django project directory `djangoprojects/movieProject` using command below

  ```bash
  cd movieProject
  ```

- Now create a Django app named `movieApp` using command below

  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp movieApp
  ```

- Now open this project directory `djangoprojects/movieProject` in your IDE VS Code using command

  ```bash
  code .
  ```

- First open the `settings.py` file in `movieProject` folder, and search for property `INSTALLED_APPS` and append the name of `movieApp` to add this app

  ```python
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'movieApp',
  ]
  ```

#### Create the Model

- Open `models.py` to create model class in it
- modify the `models.py` file as per below code

  ```python
  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Movie(models.Model):

      name = models.CharField(max_length=40)
      releaseDate = models.DateField()
      rating = models.DecimalField(max_digits=2, decimal_places=1)
  ```

#### Create the ModelForm

- we'll create out Model Form in a file `forms.py` that needs to be created
  - In IDE, create a file `forms.py` under the app directory `movieApp`
  - Open this form file `forms.py`, and add the code below to create a add movie form

    ```python
    from django import forms
    from movieApp.models import Movie

    class MovieForm(forms.ModelForm):
        """Form definition for Movie."""

        class Meta:
            """Meta definition for Movieform."""

            model = Movie
            fields = '__all__'

    ```

#### Create the Views

- We need to create views to render data to and from between models and templates
  - Open `views.py` file in `movieApp`
  - Modify the `views.py` as per below code to add three views `indexView`, `listMoviesView` and `addMovieView`

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from movieApp.models import Movie
from movieApp.forms import MovieForm

# Create your views here.
def indexView(request):
    return render(request, 'movieApp/index.html')

def listMoviesView(request):
    moviesList = Movie.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'movieApp/listMovies.html', {'moviesList':moviesList})

def addMovieView(request):
    movieFormData = MovieForm()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        movieForm_request_post = MovieForm(request.POST)
        if movieForm_request_post.is_valid():
            movieForm_request_post.save()
            print('MovieForm is valid')
            print('Movie Name:', movieForm_request_post.cleaned_data['name'])
            print('Movie Release Date:', str(movieForm_request_post.cleaned_data['releaseDate']))
            print('Movie Rating:', str(movieForm_request_post.cleaned_data['rating']))
        return indexView(request)
    return render(request, 'movieApp/addMovie.html', {'movieForm':movieFormData})
```

#### Create the Templates

- Before creating templates, we need to configure the templates
  - In your IDE, Create a folder `templates/movieApp` inside the project folder `movieProject`
  - Now add this path, open `settings.py` file, search for `TEMPLATES` property, and in `DIRS` append as below, we'll add `BASE_DIR` as `templates` only, rest of the path, we've specified in respective views
  
    ```python
    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates', ],
            'APP_DIRS': True,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',
                    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                    'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
                ],
            },
        },
    ]
    ```

- Now we need to create three template files in `templates/movieApp` folder, and then modify as per code shown below
  
  1. `index.html`
      - Modify it as below

        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title>Movies</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <a href="/listMovies">List Movies</a><br/>
                <a href="/addMovie">Add Movie</a>
            </body>
        </html>
        ```

  2. `listMovies.html`
      - Modify it as below

        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title>Movies List</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                {% if moviesList %}
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Release Date</th>
                        <th>Rating</th>
                    </thead>
                    {% for movie in moviesList %}
                        <tr>
                        <td>{{ movie.name }}</td>
                        <td>{{ movie.releaseDate }}</td>
                        <td>{{ movie.rating }}</td>
                        </tr>
                    {% endfor %}
                </table>
                {% else %}
                    <p>No Movies Found !!</p>
                {% endif %}
            </body>
        </html>
        ```

  3. `addMovie.html`
      - Modify it as below

        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title>Add Movie</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Add Movie</h1>
                <form method="post">
                    {{ movieForm.as_p }}
                    {% csrf_token %}
                    <input type="submit" value="Add Movie">
                </form>
            </body>
        </html>
        ```

#### Configure the URLs

- To configure the URLS, open `urls.py` file and add path to the three views you've created as per below code

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from movieApp import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('', views.indexView),
      path('listMovies/', views.listMoviesView),
      path('addMovie/', views.addMovieView),
  ]
  ```

#### Do the migrations

- Before doing migrations, we need to configure the database connection
  - Open MySQL Workbench and create a database `moviesdb` using command below

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE moviesdb;
  ```

  - Once database is created, now open `settings.py` in IDE, we need to configure `DATABASES` property, search for it and make changes as per below snippet

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': 'moviesdb',
            'USER': 'root',
            'PASSWORD': 'mysql',
        }
    }
    ```
  
  - Now to test this database connection, goto the command-line/terminal, make sure you're at the project directory `djangoprojects/movieProject`, then launch python interactive shell using command

    ```bash
    python manage.py shell
    ```

    - Run below command in python interactive shell, if it doesn't give any error message, it means our connection is good to go

      ```python
      from django.db import connection
      c = connection.cursor()
      ```

- Once database connection is configured, you may exit the python interactive shell using `Ctrl+D`, and now we can run migrations
- To make migrations run the command below, it should generate a `movieApp\migrations\0001_initial.py` file

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```

- Now do migration using command, it'll apply all the migrations to create the tables for the app `movieApp`

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- To check if the tables have been created, goto MySQL Workbench and run command below to list all tables, it should list a app table `movieapp_movie`

  ```sql
  USE moviesdb;
  SHOW TABLES;
  ```

- To list the contents of `movieapp_movie` table, use command below

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM movieapp_movie;
  ```

#### Test the Application

- To test the application, you need to run the Django server
- Goto the command-line/terminal, make sure you're in the project directory `djangoprojects/movieProject`, and run the command below to run Django server

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

- Now goto web-browser and visit URL at `localhost:8000` to visit the `index` page which has two links
  - Open `List Movies` link, it should show `No Movies Found !!` message as database has no data
  - Go back to `index` page and open `Add Movie` link, it should load the Model Form that we've created
    - Fill out this form (make sure date is in format `MM/DD/YYYY`) and submit it, it should take you to `index` page
  - Now go back to `List Movies` link, it'll show you the data from database
- To Stop the server do `Ctrl+C`
