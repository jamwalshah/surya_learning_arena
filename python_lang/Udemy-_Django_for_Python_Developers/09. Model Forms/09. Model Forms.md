# 09. Model Forms

## 081. Introduction

- In this section, you'll be learning how to use Model based forms
- Model based forms make our life so much easier, because we develop the form based on a particular Model class we've already created
- So, you'll create a class called `MyForm` or whatever name, which will inherit `forms.ModelForm` this time
- And we need not specify all the fields from scratch, we simply use a `Meta` class and tell Django which Model, this form should be based off, for example `model = Employee`, and on that Model we can optionally specify the fields we want to include, weather you want to include all the fields `fields = '__all__'` or only some of the fields which you can do using a list
- The advantage here is that we can directly take the data that comes from this form, and save it to the database because we have a link from this form to the  Model and to the database
- So our work as a developer is lot more easier if we use Model forms

## 082. Hands On Steps

- In the next few lectures, we'll be creating Model based forms
- To do that, you'll
  1. first `Create a Model` object
  2. then `Create the Form` of the Model object, once you have the Model, you need not repeat all those fields in the form, you can use a meta class and tell that we want to use all the fields from that Model
  3. then `Create the View` which will render the form as well as this view is responsible for processing the data once the form is submitted and even save the data to the database
  4. we'll also `Create the HTML templates`
  5. `Configure the URLs and Test` our application
- The Model we're going to work on is a Project, it could be a roadwork, it could be a software project, which will have `startDate`, `endDate`, `name`, `assignedTo` and `priority`
- The home page will display two links
  1. `List Project`
  2. `Add Project`
- When clicked on `Add Project`, it'll go to the form that you'll be creating, this form is based on the Model class we'll be creating, we'll have all the fields from the Model, you can add the project details in the form, and once we submit it, it'll submit to the database
- Then we can look at all the projects by clicking on the `List Projects` link, and it'll display all the projects in the database to the end-user as an HTML table

## 083. Create the project and model

- The first step is to create a Project and create a Model within that project called `Project`
- The `Project` Model should have the following fields, `startDate`, `endDate`, `name`, `assignedTo` and `priority`
- Goto your command-line/terminal, make sure you're under the project's directory `djangoprojects`, and create a new project using the command below

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject modelFormsDemo
  ```

- change directory into that project `modelFormsDemo` using command below

  ```bash
  cd modelFormsDemo
  ```

- Once you're in there, use the command below to create an app `modelForms`

  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp modelForms
  ```

- Grab your project and open it in your IDE
- Now, create a folder named `templates` in the project directory `djangoprojects\modelFormsDemo`
- Now, goto `settings.py` and lets do the templates, search for `TEMPLATES` property and add the templates directory to the `DIRS` in it

  ```python
  TEMPLATES = [
      {
          'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
          'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],
          'APP_DIRS': True,
          'OPTIONS': {
              'context_processors': [
                  'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                  'django.template.context_processors.request',
                  'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                  'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
              ],
          },
      },
  ]
  ```

- Now goto `models.py` and Lets create a model class `Project(models.Model)` there

  ```python
  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Project(models.Model):
      startDate = models.DateField()
      endDate  = models.DateField()
      name = models.CharField()
      assignedTo = models.CharField()
      priority = models.IntegerField()
      
  ```

- In this lecture, we've created a project set it to use templates, and also, you've created the model for it which has 5 fields

## 084. Create the Model form

- The next step is to create a form using the Model which we've already developed
- Now goto app `ModelForms`, and create a new file in it called `forms.py` which is where our forms will live
  - In `forms.py`, create a Model class `ProjectForm(forms.ModelForm)`, which has a class `Meta`
  - Now you need to import your Model class `Project` from `modelForms.models`
  - Inside `Meta` class, specify the `model` as your model class `Project`, `fields` will be set to `__all__` which tells Django that we want to include all the fields from our Model class `Project`
  - You can also include only some of the fields, or we can exclude some of the fields, we'll show you later on once we run this project

    ```python
    from django import forms
    from modelForms.models import Project

    class ProjectForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = Project
            fields = '__all__'
    ```

- In this lecture, we have learnt how to create a Model form by inheriting your form class from `forms.ModelForm`, inside that you create a `Meta` class as an inner class which tells Django which model should be used in this form and also the fields that should be included from that Model

## 085. Create the Views

- In this lecture you'll start creating the views for our application
- There are three different views
  1. `index.html` : is responsible for rendering the index page which is the starting point of our application, and in this page there will be options for the end user with two links which are the other two views
  2. `listProjects.html` : first link on index page will render this view which is responsible for rendering this template that will list all the projects in the database
  3. `addProject.html` : second link on index page will render third view which is where end-user can add a project to the database, this is where we're using the form that we've created
- Goto your IDE, we'll create a couple of views in this lecture, and the third one in the next lecture
- Open `views.py`, and first import `ProjectForm` from `modelForms.forms` and `Project` from `modelForms.models`
  - Now create a view function for the first view as `index(request)` which will render the template `modelForms/index.html`
  - Create view function for another view as `listProjects(request)` which will first fetch all the records/projects from the database, and then render it to template `modelForms/listProjects.html`

    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from modelForms.forms import ProjectForm
    from modelForms.models import Project

    # Create your views here.
    def index(request):
        return render(request, 'modelForms/index.html')

    def listProjects(request):
        projectsList = Project.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'modelForms/listProjects.html', {'projects':projectsList})
    ```

- So, in this lecture, we've successfully created two different view, the `index(request)` view which is responsible for rendering the `index.html` template, and the `listProjects(request)` view that will retrieve all the projects from the database and it'll send it to a template `listProjects.html`

## 086. Create the Add Project View

- The last view is the `addProject` view, this is a little more involved compared with other views, as this is where we are going to use the form that we've created
- Create a view function `addProject(request)` which will render the form `ProjectForm` that we've created to the template `modelForms/AddProject.html`
  - Once we submit the submit button, we have to handle the form using the `request` object, we check if the method of form request is `POST`, then we check, if the `request.POST` that form has sent is valid or not using `form.is_valid()`, and if found valid we use `form.save()` method to save the changes in the model because this form is a Model form which inherits the `forms.ModelForm`
  - and at the end of this view, we'll return the `index(request)` view by passing it the request, which is exactly how we navigate from one UI/view to another view
  - So when the user finishes submitting the form, instead of going back to the same form, we can goto the index page where the user can select among the options to list the projects or add a project here

    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from modelForms.forms import ProjectForm
    from modelForms.models import Project

    # Create your views here.
    def index(request):
        return render(request, 'modelForms/index.html')

    def listProjects(request):
        projectsList = Project.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'modelForms/listProjects.html', {'projects':projectsList})

    def addProject(request):
        form = ProjectForm()
        if form.method == 'POST':
            form = ProjectForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                form.save()
            return index(request=request)
        return render(request, 'modelForms/AddProject.html', {'form':form})
    ```

- In this lecture, we've successfully created a `addProject(request)` view that takes a request, `ProjectForm` is the form that we initially displayed to the user, once he enters the data we're handling the data using the POST request `request.POST` that comes in and if the form request method `form.method` is POST, then we're getting the form that has all the data from the POST request `request.POST`, then we're validating the form request `form.is_valid()`, then we're saving the form request data `form` by invoking the `form.save()`, and then we're returning the user to the `index(request)` view

## 087. Create the Index Template

- In this lecture, we'll start creating the templates or the HTML pages
- To do that, goto the `templates` directory and create a new folder under it named `modelForms`
- Now create the first template file `index.html` in `djangoprojects/modelFormsDemo/templates/modelForms` directory
- Now open this `templates/modelForms/index.html` file, and modify it as per below code to add two links to other two templates

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Projects</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <a href="/listProjects">List Projects</a><br/>
          <a href="/addProjects">Add Projects</a>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- So this is the first template

## 088. Create the List Projects Template

- The second template that we're going to create is the `listProjects.html`
- Goto the `templates/modelForms` directory and create a new template file `listProjects.html` in `djangoprojects/modelFormsDemo/templates/modelForms` directory
- Now open this `templates/modelForms/listProjects.html` file, and modify it as per below code

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Projects List</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          {% if projects %}
          <table>
              <thead>
                  <th>Name</th>
                  <th>Start Date</th>
                  <th>End Date</th>
                  <th>Assigned To</th>
                  <th>Priority</th>
              </thead>
              {% for project in projects %}
                  <tr>
                      <td>{{ project.name }}</td>
                      <td>{{ project.startDate }}</td>
                      <td>{{ project.endDate }}</td>
                      <td>{{ project.assignedTo }}</td>
                      <td>{{ project.priority }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          {% else %}
          <p>No Projects Found</p>
          {% endif %}
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- So, we've created a template for listing the projects, within which we're checking if the `projects` exist from the data/view, if there are projects then we're rendering it in a table, along with that we're using Django `for` template tag to render one row per record in the database, otherwise if we don't have any projects from the view, we'll display a message for no projects found

## 089. Create the Add Project Template

- The last template is the `addProject.html`
- Before we move ahead, make sure that this `listProjects.html` template is under the `templates/modelForms` directory, not under directly `templates`, otherwise, move this file to `templates/modelForms`
- Goto the `templates/modelForms` directory and create a new template file `addProject.html` in `djangoprojects/modelFormsDemo/templates/modelForms` directory
- Now open this `templates/modelForms/addProjects.html` file, and modify it as per below code

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Add Project</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Add Project:</h1>
          <form method="post">
              {{ form.as_p }}
              {% csrf_token %}
              <input type="submit" value="Add Project">
          </form>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

## 090. Configure URLs

- The last step is to configure the URLs for our views
- Start doing that by opening the `urls.py` file, and modify the file as shown below to add paths to the three views `index`, `listProjects` & `addProject`

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from modelForms import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('', views.index), # empty route means root path of app
      path('listProjects/', views.listProjects),
      path('addProject/', views.addProject),
  ]
  ```

- So, we've configured all the three URLs successfully

## 091. Configure MySQL
