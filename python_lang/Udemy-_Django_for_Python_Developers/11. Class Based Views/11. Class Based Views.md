# 11. Class Based Views

## 107. CBV in Action

- In this lecture, you'll create your very first `Class-Based-View`
- To do that, goto the terminal/command-line, under the projects directory `djangoprojects`, create a new project `classBasedViews` using command below

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject classBasedViews
  ```

- Change directory into project directory `classBasedViews`

  ```bash
  cd classBasedViews
  ```

- Create a Django App `cbvApp` in this project

  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp cbvApp
  ```

- Goto the project directory `djangoprojects\classBasedViews` and open it in your IDE
- Open `views.py` file, Creating a Class-Based-View is very easy, so create a class `GreetingView()` which should extend `View` from `django.views.generic`
  - And within this class `GreetingView()`, we're going to define separate methods for each HTTP method we're going to support, for now just add `get(self, request)`, so when a HTTP `GET` method is invoked this method will get the request and also has access to self, within this method we'll return the `HttpResponse()` just like we've done earlier by importing `HttpResponse` from `django.http`, and pass in the string that you want

    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.views.generic import View
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    # Create your views here.
    class GreetingView(View):
        def get(self, request):
            return HttpResponse("<b>First CBV says hello !!</b>")
    ```

- Goto `urls.py` file which is under the project itself, configure a new `path()` setting the route as root directory `/` by specifying an empty string, and view as a call to `as_view()` method in `views.GreetingView` which is expected to be callable object/method so that this additional step of `as_view()` will invoke a function call to return an HTTP Response.
  - So when a GET request is received on this URL path, it creates an instance of views class `GreetingView`, the request goes to the `get()` method of this class which will return a `HttpResponse` with some content that will be rendered to the template.

    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path
    from cbvApp import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', views.GreetingView.as_view()),
    ]
    ```

- Goto `settings.py` file
  - goto `INSTALLED_APPS` property and append the App `cbvApp` here

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'cbvApp'
    ]
    ```

- Goto the terminal/command-line, start the Django server using command below

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

- Open the web-browser and visit the URL at `localhost:8000`, and it should display a message `First CBV says hello !!`
- In this lecture, we've successfully created a Class-Based-View
  - We've created a project, then an Application
  - Within `views.py` we've created a class `GreetingView` which inherits from `django.views.generic.View` and inside this class we need to override the HTTP methods, one method for each HTTP method, if you want to support the `GET` request then implement the `get()` method, and if you want support the `POST` request then implement the `post()` method and so on.
  - This `get()` method takes a request and we need to return an `HttpResponse`
  - In `urls.py` the `path()` method expects a callable object/method, we can't use only the view class name, so we use `views.GreetingView.as_view()`
  - When a request comes in, internally this `as_view()` method will resolve to the view class `GreetingView` and is responsible for figuring which method (GET/POST/etc.) is coming in the incoming request and will call the appropriate method on this class, if is `GET` request, it'll call `get()` method or if it is `POST` request, it'll call the `post()` method and so on

## 108. Setting Attributes on a CBV

- All the code in Class-Based-Views will go into the the methods that we define in the view class
- But we can also define attribute in this class, although not required, we can define attributes in the class and set/assign values to those attributes from within the `as_view()` function at runtime
- Goto `views.py` file, and we'll customize the message content that is displayed from the `get()` function instead of hardcoding it like earlier, by passing a message right from `as_view()` function call from the `path()` in `urls.py`, modify the `views.py` as per code below

  ```python
  from django.shortcuts import render
  from django.views.generic import View
  from django.http import HttpResponse

  # Create your views here.
  class GreetingView(View):
      greetingMessage = '<b>First CBV says hello !!</b>'
      def get(self, request):
          return HttpResponse(content=self.greetingMessage)
  ```

- Now we can override this `greetingMessage` from within the `as_view()` in `urls.py` as below

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from cbvApp import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path(route='', view=views.GreetingView.as_view(greetingMessage = '<h1>Hello from the as_view method</h1>')),
  ]
  ```

- This is how we can pass the data or set the attributes on a particular view from the `urls.py` file, because when the Django server request comes in, `as_view()` method will create an instance of the view class `GreetingView` and it is also responsible for setting the values for all the attribute in that class, internally it'll use other methods to do that, so we can pass to it whichever attribute we want
- Django server should've reloaded everything for us, goto the web-browser and refresh the URL at `localhost:8000` and you'll see a different message that says `Hello from the as_view method`
- Initially `First CBV says hello !!` will be the message it'll hold, but when the request comes in it'll set `Hello from the as_view method` as the value

## 109. Hands on Steps

- In the next few lectures, you'll be performing CRUD operations on the same `Student` model/database table that you've created earlier, but this time using Class-Based-Views, it's going to be much more easier than compared to Function-Based-Views to perform the CRUD operations
- You'll display the details of a student, you'll allow user to add a student where he can fill in the form just like before, and he can click on a student on a link in `Id` column, and then we'll be able to see the student details, if he wants to delete the student he can or he can update the student's test score
- We can allow what fields he can update which we'll configure, and if we click on delete, there will be a confirmation as well, and if you click cancel then it'll go back to the Student Details page
- All that will come for us when we use Class-Based-Views

## 110. Create Project

- In this lecture, we'll create a Class-Based-View project to perform the CRUD operations
- To do that, goto terminal/command-line, make sure you're under the project directory `djangoprojects`, create a new project `cbvCRUD` using command below, which uses Class-Based-Views using generics

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject cbvCRUD
  ```

- Go into the project directory `djangoprojects\cbvCRUD`

  ```bash
  cd cbvCRUD
  ```

- Create an app `cbvApp` using command below

  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp cbvApp
  ```

- Goto that project folder `djangoprojects\cbvCRUD`, and open it in your IDE
- Open the `settings.py` file, search for `INSTALLED_APPS` property, append the app `cbvApp` to this list as below

  ```python
  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.messages',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'cbvApp'
  ]
  ```

- The next setting is the database setting, in `settings.py` file, search for `DATABASES` property, and update it as below which is same as you've done in `fbvCRUD` project

  ```python
  DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
          'NAME': 'studentdb',
          'USER': 'root',
          'PASSWORD': 'mysql',
      }
  }
  ```

- We don't need to configure the template here, because the this time templates will eb automatically resolved for us, we don't have to configure a specific template directory, thanks to generics
- Next we will create the models, using the same model as we used in `fbvCRUD` project, we'll create here also, open the `models.py` file and create the model as below

  ```python
  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Student(models.Model):
      """Model definition for Student."""
      firstName = models.CharField(max_length=20)
      lastName = models.CharField(max_length=20)
      testScore = models.FloatField()
  ```

- In this lecture, we've successfully created a project, and also a model
- In the next lecture, you'll see how easy it is to use generics and perform CRUD operations, one operation at a time

## 111. Create List View

- In this lecture, we'll learn how to create views using generics
- Goto `views.py` file, since we're going to use generics, so import `ListView` for now from `django.views.generic`
- next crate a class `StudentListView(ListView)` which will extend the `ListView`, and in this class, all we need to provide is model class, but after importing `student` model from `cbvCRUD.models`, so it'll fetch all the data for the students which will be sent to a default `template_name` parameter is a template named in format `modelname_list.html` resulting into template file `student_list.html`, so we'll require to create a template with this name and the `context_object_name` parameter is available in the format `modelname_list` resulting into context variable `student_list`, we can loop through this context variable and play around it
- If you want to override the `template_name`, you may specify it using the class attribute `template_name` inside the view class `StudentListView`

  ```python
  from django.shortcuts import render
  from django.views.generic import ListView
  from cbvApp.models import Student

  # Create your views here.
  class StudentListView(ListView):
      """ListView definition for view to list data from Student Model"""
      model = Student
      # template_name = 'student_list.html'
      # default template_name is student_list.html
      # context_object_name = 'student_list'
      # default context_object_name is student_list
  ```

- In the next lecture, we'll be creating a template `student_list.html` and we'll be using the context variable `student_list` to display the student data
- In this lecture, you've created your very first generic view by extending the `ListView` and simply providing it the Model class name `Student`

## 112. Create List Template

- In this lecture, we'll create the `student_list.html` template
- To do that, we'll have to create a folder under our `cbvApp`, so that by default Django generics will search for this template under `cbvApp/templates/cbvApp`, and in this folder create a template file named `student_list.html`
- In `student_list.html`, you may put the HTML from the `index.html` from `fbvCRUD` project, and then modify it as below code by changing the context variable to `student_list`
- The links to `Add Student`, `Delete` and `Update` will be moved later on, but for now leave them there, and `Delete` & `Update` links will be moved to student Details page which you'll be creating later on

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Student Information</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in student_list %}
                  <tr>
                      <td>{{ student.id }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore }}</td>
                      <td><a href="/delete/{{ student.id }}">Delete</a></td>
                      <td><a href="/update/{{ student.id }}">Update</a></td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

## 113. Test List View

- In this lecture, we'll configure the URLs, do the migrations and test our application
- Goto `urls.py`, add a `path()` with route as `students/` and views as `StudentListView.as_view()`

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from cbvApp import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('students/', views.StudentListView),
  ]
  ```

- Goto the terminal/command-line, make sure that you're under the project directory `djangoprojects\cbvCRUD`, and do the migrations, Although the database is same, but we're using a different app, so it'll generate a different table

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- Now all the migrations are in, now if you goto the MySQL Workbench, and list all the tables using command below, along with previous table `fbvapp_student`, we now have `cbvapp_student`

  ```sql
  USE studentdb;
  SHOW TABLES;
  ```

- First list all records from table `cbvapp_student`, and it show not list any records as it is an empty table

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cbvapp_student;
  ```

- Lets insert a record into the `cbvapp_student` table, and we'll have one record in the table

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO cbvapp_student VALUES (1, 'John', 'Feguson', 90);
  ```

- Start the Django server for this project using command below

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

- Now, goto the web-browser, and visit the URL at `localhost:8000`, and you'll get an error message `Page not found (404)` indicating that the URL patterns are `admin/` and `students/`
- Now open the URL at `localhost:8000/students`, and you'll see the records from the database in a table format
- So, with the very minimal work of simply implementing a view, once we have a `Model` class, we implement a `ListView` class by extending it, provide a model to it, and it'll take care of fetching the data for us and sending it to a template which we've created in the folder `cbvApp/template/cbvApp` which is being rendered beautifully

## 114. Implement Student Details

- In this lecture, you'll learn how to use the `DetailView` from the `django.views.generic`
- We'll provide a link on the `Id` column, when that link is clicked, it should display all the Student details on a separate page from which you can `Update` and `Delete` later on
- Goto `views.py` file, and define a new view class `StudentDetailView(DetailView)` which will extend `DetailView` from `django.views.generic`
, and all we need to do is to provide Model information
  - The default context parameter name and template name are different here
  - The default `template_name` will be in format `modelname_detail.html`, resulting into `student_detail.html`
  - The default `context_object_name` will be in format `modelname`, resulting into `student`
  - So you can access the `student` context parameter in the template `student_detail.html`

    ```python
    class StudentDetailView(DetailView):
        """DetailView definition for view to display detail data from Student Model"""
        model = Student
        # template_name = 'student_list.html'
        # default template_name is student_list.html
        # context_object_name = 'student_list'
        # default context_object_name is student_list
    ```

- Now Create a template file `cbvApp/templates/cbvApp/student_detail.html`, open it and add the html code below to it

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Student Details</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Student Details</h1>
          <ol>
              <h3><li>First Name: {{ student.firstName }}</li></h3>
              <h3><li>Last Name: {{ student.lastName }}</li></h3>
              <h3><li>Test Score: {{ student.testScore }}</li></h3>
          </ol>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- So, you've successfully implemented the view and the template
- Goto `urls.py` file, add a `path()` as shown below

  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from cbvApp import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('students/', views.StudentListView.as_view()),
      path('<int:pk>/', views.StudentDetailView.as_view()),
  ]
  ```

- Now we have to add the route URL to the link in the `student_list.html` template on the `Id` column
- Goto the `student_list.html` file, and add the link `/{{ student.id }}` to the `Id` column as below, which is the URL we have mapped in the route, all it expects is the primary key `pk`, which should goto the `DetailView`

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Student Information</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Students</h1>
          <table border=2>
              <thead>
                  <th>Id</th>
                  <th>First Name</th>
                  <th>Last Name</th>
                  <th>Test Score</th>
              </thead>
              {% for student in student_list %}
                  <tr>
                      <td><a href="/{{ student.id }}">{{ student.id }}</a></td>
                      <td>{{ student.firstName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.lastName }}</td>
                      <td>{{ student.testScore }}</td>
                      <td><a href="/delete/{{ student.id }}">Delete</a></td>
                      <td><a href="/update/{{ student.id }}">Update</a></td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br/><br/><br/>
          <a href="/create">Add Student</a>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- Now goto the web-browser and refresh/visit the URL at `localhost:8000/students`, and it'll load the `Id` column with a link
  - Click on the Id column value `1`, and it'll open the `DetailsView` template page, which displays all the student details `First Name`, `Last Name` and `Test Score`
- To summarize the steps
  - To use the `DetailView`, we start by creating a new class `StudentDetailView` that extends the `DetailView`, you tell it the Model class `Student` that this DetailView class is responsible for rendering, it'll fetch the data and put the data into an object `student` using the Model name in lower-case, it'll send the data by default to `student_detail.html` template, so that Django template loader will look for the template under `ProjectName/AppName/templates/AppName/student_detail.html`, which is where we're rendering our data, and the link for it is the primary key `pk` of that particular `student` model object, once the URL is mapped, you can use that in the list page `student_list.html` on the `Id` column, so that when that is clicked, that student's details will be rendered

## 115. Create

- So far, we've successfully performed the `Read` operations, that is reading all the students, displaying them, and also the student details
- In this and the next lecture, you'll work on the `Create` operation
- To do that, goto `views.py` file
  - First import `CreateView` from the `django.views.generic`
  - Create a new class `StudentCreateView(CreateView)` which will extend the `CreateView`
    - Within this class define the Model and there is also an additional attribute called `fields`, without which you'll get an error at runtime
    - in this `fields` attribute, we need to tell which fields we need to insert during the insertion or creation process
    - we have four different fields in this table, but `id` field we need not give it, so assign a tuple of fields `firstName`, `lastName`, `testScore` to `fields` attribute
    - You can also ignore some fields if you don't want to provide values for them
    - The default template_name will be in format `modelname_form.html`, resulting into `student_form.html`

      ```python
      class StudentCreateView(CreateView):
          model = Student
          fields = ('firstName', 'lastName', 'testScore')
          # template_name = 'student_form.html'
          # default template_name is student_form.html
          # context_object_name = 'form'
          # default context_object_name is form
      ```

- Now create a template file `cbvApp/templates/cbvApp/student_form.html`, and add the code below

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <title>Create Student</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Create Student</h1>
          <form method="post">
              {{ form.as_p }}
              {% csrf_token %}
              <input type="submit" value="Save">
          </form>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- In this lecture
  - you've created a Student View, added a new attribute called `fields` which is required for Update as well
  - then you've created a template with name in format `ModelName_form.html` resulting into `student_from.html` under your templates folder, and within that you've added a form that will eb rendered to you
- There is an additional step which we need to do in the Model class for Create to work, we need to mention where it should go after the create operation
  - we can do that in Create View class by providing a result URL or we can do that in the Model class by overriding a method, out of which overriding the method is th preferred way and will be shown later

## 116. Test Create

- In this lecture, we'll tell Django where it should go after `StudentCreateView` is created and will configure the URL and test our application
- To do that, goto `models.py`, adn we need to create a function `get_absolute_url(self)` inside class `Student(models.Model)` within which a view needs to be returned that will be used when the creation process is completed, and this function will be invoked by Django automatically
- In the `get_absolute_url()` function in `models.py`, it expects a primary key as indicated in the URL path for view with name `detail` and second parameter it expects is the primary which we pass using the `pk` in the model itself, referenced using `self.pk`

  ```python
  from django.db import models
  from django.urls import reverse
  # Create your models here.
  class Student(models.Model):
      """Model definition for Student."""
      firstName = models.CharField(max_length=20)
      lastName = models.CharField(max_length=20)
      testScore = models.FloatField()
      
      def get_absolute_url(self):
          return reverse('detail', kwargs={'pk': self.pk})
  ```

- And we'll need the URL path name in the `reverse()` function for the view to which we want it to go after creation process, open `urls.py` file and modify it as below to add a path `name` parameter to the URL path for `views.StudentDetailView`

  ```python
  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('students/', views.StudentListView.as_view()),
      path('<int:pk>/', views.StudentDetailView.as_view(), name='detail'),
  ]
  ```

- Now goto `urls.py` file, and create a new URL path for this `StudentCreateView` as indicated below

  ```python
  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('students/', views.StudentListView.as_view()),
      path('<int:pk>/', views.StudentDetailView.as_view(), name='detail'),
      path('create/', views.StudentCreateView.as_view())
  ]
  ```

- Goto your command line, Django server is already running, make sure there are no errors
- Now open web-browser and open the URL at `localhost:8000/students`, and click on `Add Student` link, and a form will be rendered, Enter FirstName, LastName and TestScore, and click on `Save`, and it'll load the `StudentDetailView` to show the details of the student
- So it creates a record in the database, and then goes to the Student Details Page
- You can check the database if you want to, open the MySQL Workbench, and run the SELECt query below to see all the data

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM cbvapp_student;
