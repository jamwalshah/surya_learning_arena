# 11. Class Based Views

## 107. CBV in Action

- In this lecture, you'll create your very first `Class-Based-View`
- To do that, goto the terminal/command-line, under the projects directory `djangoprojects`, create a new project `classBasedViews` using command below

  ```bash
  django-admin startproject classBasedViews
  ```

- Change directory into project directory `classBasedViews`

  ```bash
  cd classBasedViews
  ```

- Create a Django App `cbvApp` in this project

  ```bash
  python manage.py startapp cbvApp
  ```

- Goto the project directory `djangoprojects\classBasedViews` and open it in your IDE
- Open `views.py` file, Creating a Class-Based-View is very easy, so create a class `GreetingView()` which should extend `View` from `django.views.generic`
  - And within this class `GreetingView()`, we're going to define separate methods for each HTTP method we're going to support, for now just add `get(self, request)`, so when a HTTP `GET` method is invoked this method will get the request and also has access to self, within this method we'll return the `HttpResponse()` just like we've done earlier by importing `HttpResponse` from `django.http`, and pass in the string that you want

    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django.views.generic import View
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    # Create your views here.
    class GreetingView(View):
        def get(self, request):
            return HttpResponse("<b>First CBV says hello !!</b>")
    ```

- Goto `urls.py` file which is under the project itself, configure a new `path()` setting the route as root directory `/` by specifying an empty string, and view as a call to `as_view()` method in `views.GreetingView` which is expected to be callable object/method so that this additional step of `as_view()` will invoke a function call to return an HTTP Response.
  - So when a GET request is received on this URL path, it creates an instance of views class `GreetingView`, the request goes to the `get()` method of this class which will return a `HttpResponse` with some content that will be rendered to the template.

    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path
    from cbvApp import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', views.GreetingView.as_view()),
    ]
    ```

- Goto `settings.py` file
  - goto `INSTALLED_APPS` property and append the App `cbvApp` here

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'cbvApp'
    ]
    ```

- Goto the terminal/command-line, start the Django server using command below

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

- Open the web-browser and visit the URL at `localhost:8000`, and it should display a message `First CBV says hello !!`
- In this lecture, we've successfully created a Class-Based-View
  - We've created a project, then an Application
  - Within `views.py` we've created a class `GreetingView` which inherits from `django.views.generic.View` and inside this class we need to override the HTTP methods, one method for each HTTP method, if you want to support the `GET` request then implement the `get()` method, and if you want support the `POST` request then implement the `post()` method and so on.
  - This `get()` method takes a request and we need to return an `HttpResponse`
  - In `urls.py` the `path()` method expects a callable object/method, we can't use only the view class name, so we use `views.GreetingView.as_view()`
  - When a request comes in, internally this `as_view()` method will resolve to the view class `GreetingView` and is responsible for figuring which method (GET/POST/etc.) is coming in the incoming request and will call the appropriate method on this class, if is `GET` request, it'll call `get()` method or if it is `POST` request, it'll call the `post()` method and so on
