# Airflow: Local Development Environment

[Airflow: Local Development Environment](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101/local-development-environment)

Set up a local development environment for Airflow!

## ðŸ“š About this Module

Welcome to the Local Development Environment Module!

In this Module, we'll explore how to set up Airflow for local development. We'll start with an overview of the two primary ways Airflow can be installed on a local machine. Then, we'll dive into the Astro CLI, the fastest way to install and run Airflow locally and learn how to install it on a local machine (for both MacOS and Windows). Once it is installed, we will use it to boot up a new project and walk through the generated project structure. Lastly, we will see how to run the project using an IDE (VSCode) and the Astro CLI, while also covering a short overview of the Airflow UI.
