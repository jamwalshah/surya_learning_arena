# Airflow: Basics

[Airflow: Basics](https://academy.astronomer.io/airflow-basics)

Explore how Apache Airflow works under the hood and the basics of how a DAG is built!

## ðŸ“š About this Module

Welcome to the Airflow Basics Module!

In this module, we will explore the fundamentals of Apache Airflow. We will walk through each of the core components of Airflow and the role it plays in running a DAG. We'll then explore the step-by-step process of how Airflow runs a DAG. Lastly, we will break down a DAG file by exploring each individual component and its role in building a data pipeline.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

At the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Match each of the core components in Airflowâ€™s architecture to their purpose
- Identify how each of the core components in Airflowâ€™s architecture works together to run a DAG
- Identify each of the core components of a DAG file and their purpose
- Identify how to set up a dependency in Airflow using bitwise operators
- Establish connections between dependencies in a DAG by employing the terms "upstream" and "downstream."
