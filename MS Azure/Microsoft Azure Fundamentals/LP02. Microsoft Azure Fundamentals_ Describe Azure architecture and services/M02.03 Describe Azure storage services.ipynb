        "Data stored in the cloud can grow at an exponential pace. To manage costs for your expanding storage needs, it's helpful to organize your data based on attributes like frequency of access and planned retention period. Data stored in the cloud can be handled differently based on how it's generated, processed, and accessed over its lifetime. Some data is actively accessed and modified throughout its lifetime. Some data is accessed frequently early in its lifetime, with access dropping drastically as the data ages. Some data remains idle in the cloud and is rarely, if ever, accessed after it's stored. To accommodate these different access needs, Azure provides several access tiers, which you can use to balance your storage costs with your access needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Azure Storage offers different access tiers for your blob storage, helping you store object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hot access tier:** Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).\n",
        "- **Cool access tier:** Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).\n",
        "- **Cold access tier:** Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 90 days.\n",
        "- **Archive access tier:** Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).\n",
        "\n",
        "The following considerations apply to the different access tiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level. The cold and archive access tiers aren't available at the account level.\n",
        "- Hot, cool, cold, and archive tiers can be set at the blob level, during or after upload.\n",
        "- Data in the cool and cold access tiers can tolerate slightly lower availability, but still requires high durability, retrieval latency, and throughput characteristics similar to hot data. For cool and cold data, a lower availability service-level agreement (SLA) and higher access costs compared to hot data are acceptable trade-offs for lower storage costs.\n",
        "- Archive storage stores data offline and offers the lowest storage costs, but also the highest costs to rehydrate and access data.\n",
