        "In the early years of computing systems, every application stored data in its own unique structure. When developers wanted to build applications to use that data, they had to know a lot about the particular data structure to find the data they needed. These data structures were inefficient, hard to maintain, and hard to optimize for good application performance. The *relational* database model was designed to solve the problem of multiple arbitrary data structures. The relational model provides a standard way of representing and querying data that can be used by any application. One of the key advantages of the relational database model is its use of *tables*, which are an intuitive, efficient, and flexible way to store and access structured information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simple yet powerful relational model is used by organizations of all types and sizes for a broad variety of information management needs. Relational databases are used to track inventories, process e-commerce transactions, manage huge amounts of mission-critical customer information, and much more. A relational database is useful for storing any information containing related data elements that must be organized in a rules-based, consistent structure.\n",

        "In a relational database, you model collections of entities from the real world as *tables*. An entity can be anything for which you want to record information; typically important objects and events. For example, in a retail system example, you might create tables for customers, products, orders, and line items within an order. A table contains rows, and each row represents a single instance of an entity. In the retail scenario, each row in the customer table contains the data for a single customer, each row in the product table defines a single product, each row in the order table represents an order made by a customer, and each row in the line item table represents a product that was included in an order.\n",

The available data types that you can use when defining a table depend on the database system you are using; though there are standard data types defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) that are supported by most database systems.\n",

You can look up the address of the customer (which is stored only once) for each record in the **Order** table by referencing the corresponding record in the **Customer** table. Typically, a relational database management system (RDBMS) can enforce referential integrity to ensure that a value entered into a foreign key field has an existing corresponding primary key in the related table – for example, preventing orders for non-existent customers.\n",

These extensions provide functionality not covered by the SQL standard, and include areas such as security management and programmability. For example, Microsoft SQL Server, and Azure database services that are based on the SQL Server database engine, use Transact-SQL.

For example, you could create a view on the **Order** and **Customer** tables that retrieves order and customer data to provide a single object that makes it easy to determine delivery addresses for orders:\n",

        "\n",
        "An index helps you search for data in a table. Think of an index over a table like an index at the back of a book. A book index contains a sorted set of references, with the pages on which each reference occurs. When you want to find a reference to an item in the book, you look it up through the index. You can use the page numbers in the index to go directly to the correct pages in the book. Without an index, you might have to read through the entire book to find the references you're looking for.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you create an index in a database, you specify a column from the table, and the index contains a copy of this data in a sorted order, with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table. When the user runs a query that specifies this column in the **WHERE** clause, the database management system can use this index to fetch the data more quickly than if it had to scan through the entire table row by row.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you could use the following code to create an index on the **Name** column of the **Product** table:\n",
        "\n",
        "```SQL\n",
        "CREATE INDEX idx_ProductName\n",

        "\n",
        "For a table containing few rows, using the index is probably not any more efficient than simply reading the entire table and finding the rows requested by the query (in which case the query optimizer will ignore the index). However, when a table has many rows, indexes can dramatically improve the performance of queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can create many indexes on a table. So, if you also wanted to find products based on price, creating another index on the **Price** column in the **Product** table might be useful. However, indexes aren't free. An index consumes storage space, and each time you insert, update, or delete data in a table, the indexes for that table must be maintained. This additional work can slow down insert, update, and delete operations. You must strike a balance between having indexes that speed up your queries versus the cost of performing other operations.\n",
