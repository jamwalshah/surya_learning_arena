Avro is a good format for compressing data and minimizing storage and network bandwidth requirements.\n",

It was developed by HortonWorks for optimizing read and write operations in Apache Hive (Hive is a data warehouse system that supports fast data summarization and querying over large datasets). An ORC file contains stripes of data. Each stripe holds the data for a column or set of columns. A stripe contains an index into the rows in the stripe, the data for each row, and a footer that holds statistical information (count, sum, max, min, and so on) for each column.\n",

Each row group contains one or more chunks of data. A Parquet file includes metadata that describes the set of rows found in each chunk. An application can use this metadata to quickly locate the correct chunk for a given set of rows, and retrieve the data in the specified columns for these rows. Parquet specializes in storing and processing nested data types efficiently. It supports very efficient compression and encoding schemes.\n",

For example, a customer's primary key can be referenced in a sales order record to indicate which customer placed the order. This use of keys to reference data entities enables a relational database to be *normalized*; which in part means the elimination of duplicate data values so that, for example, the details of an individual customer are stored only once; not for each sales order the customer places.

        "\n",
        "A transactional data processing system is what most people consider the primary function of business computing. A transactional system records transactions that encapsulate specific events that the organization wants to track. A transaction could be financial, such as the movement of money between accounts in a banking system, or it might be part of a retail system, tracking payments for goods and services from customers. Think of a transaction as a small, discrete, unit of work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transactional systems are often high-volume, sometimes handling many millions of transactions in a single day. The data being processed has to be accessible very quickly. The work performed by transactional systems is often referred to as Online Transactional Processing (OLTP).\n",
        "\n",
        "![Image showing a user reading and writing data in a database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-core-data-concepts/media/transactional-processing.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "OLTP solutions rely on a database system in which data storage is optimized for both read and write operations in order to support transactional workloads in which data records are created, retrieved, updated, and deleted (often referred to as CRUD operations). These operations are applied transactionally, in a way that ensures the integrity of the data stored in the database. To accomplish this, OLTP systems enforce transactions that support so-called ACID semantics:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Atomicity** – each transaction is treated as a single unit, which succeeds completely or fails completely. For example, a transaction that involved debiting funds from one account and crediting the same amount to another account must complete both actions. If either action can't be completed, then the other action must fail.\n",
        "- **Consistency** – transactions can only take the data in the database from one valid state to another. To continue the debit and credit example above, the completed state of the transaction must reflect the transfer of funds from one account to the other.\n",
        "- **Isolation** – concurrent transactions cannot interfere with one another, and must result in a consistent database state. For example, while the transaction to transfer funds from one account to another is in-process, another transaction that checks the balance of these accounts must return consistent results - the balance-checking transaction can't retrieve a value for one account that reflects the balance before the transfer, and a value for the other account that reflects the balance after the transfer.\n",
        "- **Durability** – when a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed. After the account transfer transaction has completed, the revised account balances are persisted so that even if the database system were to be switched off, the committed transaction would be reflected when it is switched on again.\n",
        "\n",

Data aggregations are across dimensions at different levels, enabling you to *drill up/down* to view aggregations at multiple hierarchical levels; for example to find total sales by region, by city, or for an individual address. Because OLAP data is pre-aggregated, queries to return the summaries it contains can be run quickly.\n",
