### Explore job roles in the world of data

There's a wide variety of roles involved in managing, controlling, and using data. Some roles are business-oriented, some involve more engineering, some focus on research, and some are hybrid roles that combine different aspects of data management. Your organization may define roles differently, or give them different names, but the roles described in this unit encapsulate the most common division of tasks and responsibilities.

The three key job roles that deal with data in most organizations are:

- **Database administrators** manage databases, assigning permissions to users, storing backup copies of data and restore data in the event of a failure.
- **Data engineers** manage infrastructure and processes for data integration across the organization, applying data cleaning routines, identifying data governance rules, and implementing pipelines to transfer and transform data between systems.
- **Data analysts** explore and analyze data to create visualizations and charts that enable organizations to make informed decisions.

> **Note:** The job *roles* define differentiated tasks and responsibilities. In some organizations, the same *person* might perform multiple roles; so in their role as database administrator they might provision a transactional database, and then in their role as a data engineer they might create a pipeline to transfer data from the database to a data warehouse for analysis.

### Database Administrator

![Database administrator icon. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-roles-responsibilities-world-of-data/media/2-database-administrator.png)](../content/2-database-administrator.png) A database administrator is responsible for the design, implementation, maintenance, and operational aspects of on-premises and cloud-based database systems. They're responsible for the overall availability and consistent performance and optimizations of databases. They work with stakeholders to implement policies, tools, and processes for backup and recovery plans to recover following a natural disaster or human-made error.

The database administrator is also responsible for managing the security of the data in the database, granting privileges over the data, granting or denying access to users as appropriate.

### Data Engineer

![Data Engineer icon. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-roles-responsibilities-world-of-data/media/2-engineer.png)](../content/2-engineer.png) A data engineer collaborates with stakeholders to design and implement data-related workloads, including data ingestion pipelines, cleansing and transformation activities, and data stores for analytical workloads. They use a wide range of data platform technologies, including relational and non-relational databases, file stores, and data streams.

They're also responsible for ensuring that the privacy of data is maintained within the cloud and spanning from on-premises to the cloud data stores. They own the management and monitoring of data pipelines to ensure that data loads perform as expected.

### Data Analyst

![Data Analyst icon. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-roles-responsibilities-world-of-data/media/2-analyst.png)](../content/2-analyst.png) A data analyst enables businesses to maximize the value of their data assets. They're responsible for exploring data to identify trends and relationships, designing and building analytical models, and enabling advanced analytics capabilities through reports and visualizations.

A data analyst processes raw data into relevant insights based on identified business requirements to deliver relevant insights.

> **Note:** The roles described here represent the key data-related roles found in most medium to large organizations. There are additional data-related roles not mentioned here, such as *data scientist* and *data architect*; and there are other technical professionals that work with data, including *application developers* and *software engineers*.

### Next unit: Identify data services

## Unit 3 of 5

### Identify data services

Microsoft Azure is a cloud platform that powers the applications and IT infrastructure for some of the world's largest organizations. It includes many services to support cloud solutions, including transactional and analytical data workloads.

Some of the most commonly used cloud services for data are described below.

> **Note:** This topic covers only some of the most commonly used data services for modern transactional and analytical solutions. Additional services are also available.

### Azure SQL

![Azure SQL logo. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-roles-responsibilities-world-of-data/media/azure-sql.png)](../content/azure-sql.png) *Azure SQL* is the collective name for a family of relational database solutions based on the Microsoft SQL Server database engine. Specific Azure SQL services include:

- **Azure SQL Database** – a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) database hosted in Azure
- **Azure SQL Managed Instance** – a hosted instance of SQL Server with automated maintenance, which allows more flexible configuration than Azure SQL DB but with more administrative responsibility for the owner.
- **Azure SQL VM** – a virtual machine with an installation of SQL Server, allowing maximum configurability with full management responsibility.

Database administrators typically provision and manage Azure SQL database systems to support line of business (LOB) applications that need to store transactional data.

Data engineers may use Azure SQL database systems as sources for data pipelines that perform extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations to ingest the transactional data into an analytical system.

Data analysts may query Azure SQL databases directly to create reports, though in large organizations the data is generally combined with data from other sources in an analytical data store to support enterprise analytics.

### Azure Database for open-source relational databases

![Azure Database for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL logos. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/explore-roles-responsibilities-world-of-data/media/azure-database.png)](../content/azure-database.png) Azure includes managed services for popular open-source relational database systems, including:

- **Azure Database for MySQL** - a simple-to-use open-source database management system that is commonly used in Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack apps.
- **Azure Database for MariaDB** - a newer database management system, created by the original developers of MySQL. The database engine has since been rewritten and optimized to improve performance. MariaDB offers compatibility with Oracle Database (another popular commercial database management system).
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** - a hybrid relational-object database. You can store data in relational tables, but a PostgreSQL database also enables you to store custom data types, with their own non-relational properties.

As with Azure SQL database systems, open-source relational databases are managed by database administrators to support transactional applications, and provide a data source for data engineers building pipelines for analytical solutions and data analysts creating reports.

### Azure Cosmos DB
