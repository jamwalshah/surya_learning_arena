It's common for stream processing solutions to capture real-time data, process it by filtering or aggregating it, and present it through real-time dashboards and visualizations (for example, showing the running total of cars that have passed along a road within the current hour), while also persisting the processed results in a data store for historical analysis alongside batch processed data (for example, to enable analysis of traffic volumes over the past year).\n",

        "4. When real-time analytics is required, a stream processing technology is used to prepare the streaming data for real-time analysis or visualization; often by filtering or aggregating the data over temporal windows.\n",

        "Spark Structured Streaming is built on a ubiquitous structure in Spark called a *dataframe*, which encapsulates a table of data. You use the Spark Structured Streaming API to read data from a real-time data source, such as a Kafka hub, a file store, or a network port, into a \"boundless\" dataframe that is continually populated with new data from the stream. You then define a query on the dataframe that selects, projects, or aggregates the data - often in temporal windows. The results of the query generate another dataframe, which can be persisted for analysis or further processing.\n",

It also unifies storage for streaming and batch data, and can be used in Spark to define relational tables for both batch and stream processing.
