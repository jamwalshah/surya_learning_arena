Instead, you can just add or remove users and service principals from the appropriate Microsoft Entra security group.\n",

Specific users from the service engineering team will upload logs and manage other users of this folder, and various Databricks clusters will analyze logs from that folder.\n",

        "To enable these activities, you could create a LogsWriter group and a LogsReader group. Then, you could assign permissions as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Add the LogsWriter group to the ACL of the **/LogData** directory with rwx permissions.\n",
        "- Add the LogsReader group to the ACL of the **/LogData** directory with r-x permissions.\n",
        "- Add the service principal object or Managed Service Identity (MSI) for ADF to the LogsWriters group.\n",

If you did not add that user to a group, but instead, you added a dedicated ACL entry for that user, you would have to remove that ACL entry from the **/LogData** directory.
