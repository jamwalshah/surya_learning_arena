The data to answer this question is typically answered through the creation of a data warehouse in which historical data is persisted in relational tables for multidimensional modeling and reporting.\n",
        "- **Diagnostic analytics**, which deals with answering the question “Why is it happening?”. This may involve exploring information that already exists in a data warehouse, but typically - involves a wider search of your data estate to find more data to support this type of analysis.\n",
        "- **Predictive analytics**, which enables you to answer the question “What is likely to happen in the future based on previous trends and patterns?”\n",
